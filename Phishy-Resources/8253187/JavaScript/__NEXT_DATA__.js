This reduces the risk of losing your funds to hacks or exploits and can also help mitigate the damage of phishing scams.","title":"1. Use Revoke.cash periodically."},"paragraph_2":{"description":"Very often, scammers try to trick you into granting them an approval to your funds. Sort your approvals by most recent to find out which approvals are to blame and revoke them to prevent further damage. Unfortunately it is not possible to \u003c0\u003erecover\u003c/0\u003e funds that have already been stolen.","title":"2.

This is usually quite cheap, but when gas fees rise it can get more expensive. If your transactions are not time sensitive, it may be wise to use services like \u003c0\u003eGasHawk\u003c/0\u003e to reduce gas fees.","question":"How much does it cost to use Revoke.cash?"},"deposited_tokens":{"answer":"Revoking approvals has no impact on your deposited or staked tokens. These tokens will stay deposited and you will still be able to withdraw them. However, if you want to add more tokens to your deposited position, you will need to grant an approval again.","question":"What happens to my deposited or staked tokens when I revoke approvals?"},"enough_to_disconnect":{"answer":"No. Disconnecting your wallet (e.g. MetaMask) does not do \u003c0\u003eanything\u003c/0\u003e to protect you from approval exploits - or most other exploits. The only thing that happens when disconnecting your wallet from a website is that that website cannot see your address anymore. But your approvals stay active.","question":"Is it enough to \"disconnect\" my wallet instead of revoking approvals?"},"hardware_wallets":{"answer":"No. In general, hardware wallets are much safer than mobile or browser-based wallets because the wallet's keys are securely stored on the device, making it impossible to steal the keys without proper access to the device. But with approvals no one \u003c0\u003eneeds\u003c/0\u003e to steal your keys to take your tokens. And because of that hardware wallets offer no extra protection against approval exploits.","question":"Can hardware wallets save me from approval exploits?"},"multiple_allowances":{"answer":"No. The way approvals work under the hood \u003c0\u003erequires\u003c/0\u003e 1 transaction per approval. So it is technically impossible to revoke multiple approvals in a single transaction.","question":"Can I revoke multiple approvals at the same time?"},"other_question":{"answer":"If you have any questions that aren't mentioned in this FAQ, please reach out on \u003c0\u003eTwitter\u003c/0\u003e or \u003c1\u003eDiscord\u003c/1\u003e. You can also read about approvals in more detail in Rosco Kalis' blog post \u003c2\u003eUnlimited ERC20 allowances considered harmful\u003c/2\u003e.","question":"My question is not listed here."},"recover_assets":{"answer":"No. Revoke.cash is a \u003c0\u003epreventative\u003c/0\u003e tool that helps you practice proper wallet hygiene. By regularly revoking active approvals you reduce the chances of becoming the victim of approval exploits. But unfortunately it cannot be used to recover any stolen funds. You should still make sure to revoke the approvals that were used to take your funds so that they cannot steal more in the future.","question":"My funds were just stolen, can I use Revoke.cash to get them back?"},"stolen_through_allowances":{"answer":"It is always hard to determine how exactly your funds were stolen. To help you diagnose the cause and mitigations, we developed an infographic that shows the most common ways that funds are stolen, which has been included below. Note that you may need to zoom in to see the details.","question":"How do I know if my funds were stolen through an approval exploit?"},"sweeper_bot":{"answer":"If you have a so-called \"sweeper bot\" on your account that steals any ETH as soon as it comes in, your seed phrase was compromised. This means that revoking approvals is not going to help with your wallet security. Unfortunately, there is no way for your wallet to recover from this. You should abandon this wallet and create a new one.","question":"I want to revoke approvals, but when I add ETH to my account it gets stolen."},"wallet_mentions_approve":{"answer":"In the tokens' smart contracts, the functions for approving and revoking approvals are the same function. The difference is that you set the approval to 0 (for ERC20 tokens) or \"false\" (for NFTs) when revoking the approval. You can verify that Revoke.cash is actually revoking the approval by clicking \"Edit Permission\" (for ERC20 tokens), or the \"data\" tab (for NFTs) in MetaMask.","question":"Why does my wallet pop-up mention \"give permission\", \"approve\" or \"set approval for all\" when revoking?"},"which_allowances":{"answer":"Choosing which approvals to revoke is always a trade-off between safety and convenience. For certain well-known protocols (e.g. Uniswap) it is most likely fine to leave approvals active, but for newer and unknown smart contracts, it is more prudent to revoke approvals. Also keep in mind that some use cases require you to keep your approvals active. For example, if you have active listings on OpenSea you need to keep the approvals in order for the listings to remain active.","question":"Which approvals do I need to revoke?"},"which_chains":{"answer":"The Revoke.cash \u003c0\u003ebrowser extension\u003c/0\u003e supports every EVM network. The Revoke.cash website supports a large number of EVM networks, the full list is included below.

Currently we support \u003c0\u003eENS\u003c/0\u003e, \u003c1\u003eUnstoppable Domains\u003c/1\u003e and \u003c2\u003eAvvy Domains\u003c/2\u003e. We may add other domain name services in the future.","question":"Which kinds of domains does Revoke.cash support?"},"whole_wallet_at_risk":{"answer":"No. An \"unlimited\" approval only applies to the token or NFT collection that you gave an approval for. So if you gave an unlimited approval for your DAI, then \u003c0\u003eall your DAI\u003c/0\u003e may be at risk, but none of your USDC. Similarly an \"unlimited\" approval for your Bored Apes does not impact your Cool Cats.","question":"If I have an \"Unlimited\" approval, does that mean my whole wallet is at risk?"}},"title":"Frequently Asked Questions"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"RzU93XiUuBCnpOJkBoQTR","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en","zh","ru","ja","es"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]}
