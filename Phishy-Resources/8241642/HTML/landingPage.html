    Something went wrong. Perhaps we can help.
   </div>
   <p>
    We are an email service provider, and email sent from
    <strong>
     <span id="url">
     </span>
    </strong>
    comes from our subscribers. So we're guessing one of our subscribers sent you a message with this link in it. Sorry for any trouble this caused you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes this issue is caused by the email client that you're using or other software you have installed such as antivirus software. You could try clicking on the link again or opening the email on another device and clicking on it there.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you clicked on this link because you wanted to unsubscribe from the email, please contact the sender directly and they will handle it right away.
   </p>
   <p>
    We are a founding member of the Email Sender &amp; Provider Coalition - an organization designed to combat the proliferation of spam. So we take extremely seriously the sending practices of our subscribers - and we demand that they practice permission-based email marketing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Again, we apologize for any inconvenience.
