The team used \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/\"\u003eOracle Container Engine for Kubernetes\u003c/a\u003e to containerize its simulation applications, and then run those models using high-performing Ampere CPUs on OCI. The team\u0026rsquo;s tech operations strategy is similar to that being adopted across industries\u0026mdash;using the automation of cloud-managed Kubernetes to pair the right processing power underneath for each workload type. For Oracle Red Bull Racing, having access to this high volume of simulations makes the team\u0026rsquo;s strategy calls more detailed and increases the confidence level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Working with Oracle Cloud enables us to make informed decisions in the spur of the moment, react quickly, and adapt to what our competitors are doing within a race,\u0026rdquo; Horner says. \u0026ldquo;Oracle Cloud is playing a key role in the outcome of every single Grand Prix that we\u0026#39;ve won this year, and every Grand Prix where we\u0026#39;ve achieved significant results, which have broken all our records this season.\u0026rdquo; The 25-year-old Verstappen set a new record for most wins in a season in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven amid so many memorable races, Verstappen\u0026rsquo;s success on the Hungaroring track in Hungary stood out as a showcase of his skill and poise, as well as how much confidence the drivers and team have in their strategy, which is led by head of race strategy Will Courtenay or principal strategy engineer Hannah Schmitz on the racetrack\u0026rsquo;s pit wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In Hungary, it was all about just being patient and choosing the right time to pit and on the right tires,\u0026rdquo; says Verstappen. \u0026ldquo;Due to strategy, we moved our way forward, relied on what we thought was right, and that\u0026#39;s how we ended up winning the race.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n","partner_name":null,"story_theme":null,"facebook_image":{"id":"CONTED7E4D1D22FA4F5A8456C29197345971","type":"DigitalAsset","typeCategory":"DigitalAssetType","name":"social-og-oracle-red-bull-racing-1200x630.jpg","fileExtension":"jpg","links":[]},"facebook_type":null,"hero_attribution_text":null,"customer_logo_black":{"id":"CONTA6DB7F8EF4E74F4A8F256A95A1513AB6","type":"DigitalAsset","typeCategory":"DigitalAssetType","name":"redull-blk.svg","fileExtension":"svg","links":[]},"story_customer_logo_alt_text":null,"facebook_locale":null,"story_card_image":null,"technical_case_study_cta":null,"robots":"index follow","twitter_title":"Oracle Red Bull Racing pushes the Formula One performance edge with Oracle Cloud","challenges_header":"Superb driving and tech-powered strategy","story_body":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen Oracle Red Bull Racing driver Max Verstappen qualified in 10th position for the Hungarian Grand Prix in July 2022, the reigning Driver\u0026rsquo;s Champion knew he\u0026rsquo;d have to battle his way through the field to even come close to a podium finish. But Verstappen and the team didn\u0026rsquo;t settle for just moving up a few places.

It helped the team earn the Constructors\u0026rsquo; World Championship, the sport\u0026rsquo;s top team prize, as well as defending Verstappen\u0026rsquo;s Driver\u0026rsquo;s World Championship. The team has a close technology partnership with Oracle, including running billions of Monte Carlo simulations using \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/\"\u003eOracle Cloud Infrastructure\u003c/a\u003e (OCI) to explore the different scenarios and outcome probabilities before and during every Grand Prix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Due to all the simulations before the race even starts, it's very easy to adapt a different strategy during the race because everything is there, everything is prepared,\u0026rdquo; Verstappen says. \u0026ldquo;I think we definitely had a strategy edge over other teams.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarning both of the top F1 trophies is no small feat, and it illustrates the team\u0026rsquo;s innovation and its embrace of data and technology to drive results. In addition to simulations for on-the-track action, Oracle technology supports Oracle Red Bull Racing\u0026rsquo;s launch of The Paddock fan engagement platform and the early stages of Red Bull Powertrain\u0026rsquo;s development of a new race engine, due to debut in 2026.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It's been an incredible season, so many highs, so many amazing performances,\u0026rdquo; says Christian Horner, team principal and CEO for Oracle Red Bull Racing. \u0026ldquo;As a team, we\u0026rsquo;ve really delivered on and off the track this season, and that relies very heavily on the technology partners that play a key role in this championship success.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e","story_results":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor Oracle Red Bull Racing, the focus on technical innovation extends well beyond the grid. Using \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cx/marketing/customer-loyalty/\"\u003eOracle CrowdTwist Loyalty and Engagement\u003c/a\u003e, the team launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/projects/loyalty-programme\"\u003eThe Red Bull Racing Paddock\u003c/a\u003e, a platform that lets fans earn points to gain access to exclusive merchandise and digital downloads. Since its launch, The Red Bull Racing Paddock has grown its loyalty membership by more than 950%. The team has continued to add capabilities and content that keep fans engaged between races and during the off season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026#39;s hugely important to stay at the cutting edge of innovation as a team, and particularly with our fan base, which is ever growing,\u0026rdquo; says Horner. \u0026ldquo;With initiatives that we\u0026#39;ve introduced like The Paddock\u0026mdash;enabling our fans to get closer to the action, to the information, to the engagement with the team\u0026mdash;it\u0026rsquo;s giving us the ability to know who our fans are. It\u0026rsquo;s something that we take incredibly seriously, interacting with the lifeblood of our team, which is of course the fans.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking ahead, the team has committed to a goal that may be every bit as tough as winning another championship: Designing and manufacturing its own race engines. Such a move would\u0026rsquo;ve been unthinkable even a few years ago for a company not already in the automotive industry, but cloud-based access to high-performance computing resources has helped changed what\u0026rsquo;s possible for such sophisticated engineering. So when Honda decided to no longer develop F1 engines, Oracle Red Bull Racing took the bold decision to develop its own engine by the 2026 season. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026#39;ve recruited the talent, we\u0026#39;ve got the infrastructure, and very importantly, we have the tools,\u0026rdquo; Horner says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCloud infrastructure levels the playing field for companies that need computing power for advanced engineering such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. Designers of products from cars to coffeemakers to electronics use CFD tools during development, but it\u0026rsquo;s traditionally required massive investment in on-premises data centers, for technology that might only be used sporadically. OCI let Oracle Red Bull Racing engineers get up and running immediately on CFD-capable computing, with no overhead when that capacity isn\u0026rsquo;t in use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The speed that we operate at is so fast, and that\u0026#39;s where Oracle\u0026rsquo;s cloud technology has really enabled us\u0026mdash;not having to wait for a data center to be built on site has let us go from a clean sheet of paper to having an engine up and running within a 12-month period,\u0026rdquo; Horner says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn another front, Oracle Red Bull Racing also participates in the F1 Esports Series Pro Championship, which sees the world\u0026rsquo;s best sim racers competing for drivers and team championships. Oracle Red Bull Racing relies on OCI for processing real-time telemetry data from the simulated races, ingesting up to 130,000 data points a second during an Esports race.

Aging and deteriorating infrastructure, for example, requires solutions involving the Internet of Things (IoT), so Xerox is applying its knowledge and talent to the cause. Creativity and speed are the coin of this realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut until recently, it took Xerox teams up to three months to implement the IT systems needed to support a new venture\u0026mdash;an eternity in the digital economy.

With 3D printing, customers can order spare parts locally, or even manufacture parts themselves, instead of ordering from far-flung, cross-ocean sources. This capability speeds up delivery and reduces the impact of supply chain disruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn late 2020, the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, installed a Xerox ElemX 3D Printer, to explore manufacturing parts at sea. The goal is to install a printer on a Navy ship, so sailors in remote areas can fix or replace parts on demand instead of carrying excess inventory or having to send a plane to the middle of the ocean to bring the spare parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back office, by automating processes such as procure-to-pay and quote-to-cash, the Xerox 3D printing team \u0026ldquo;gained the ability to transact right out of the gate,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no waiting to generate invoices and start collecting revenue, and we\u0026rsquo;re able to scale as much as needed.

Xerox developed technology that remotely monitors bridges, drawing on deep experience in sensors, analytics, and artificial intelligence to bring the physical world online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure the structural integrity of bridges, tiny fiber optic sensors are attached to measure and estimate structural strain, thermal response, bending, loads, vibrations, and corrosion, which are all indicators of structural health. When sensors detect a problem, field technicians are automatically alerted to investigate. Such real-time responses let bridge operators and owners decide whether a bridge is being over- or underutilized, or has structural problems that need repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a key

serious setbacks along the way. Early in the season, the first iterations of the Red Bull RB18 racecar were heavier and more difficult to drive, as all the F1 teams adapted to new regulations set by the F\u0026eacute;d\u0026eacute;ration Internationale de l\u0026#39;Automobile that completely revamped car designs for 2022. In the F1 season opener at the Bahrain International Circuit, technical issues late in the race forced Verstappen and P\u0026eacute;rez to retire short of the finish. Verstappen would have another \u0026ldquo;did not finish\u0026rdquo; two races later, in Australia, giving him no points in two of the first three races of his title defense. The team never blinked and pulled together to make corrections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Everyone is of course very upset when things go wrong, but also very quickly we focus on what we have to improve on,\u0026rdquo; Verstappen says. \u0026ldquo;And everyone is super motivated.

The team has a close technology partnership with Oracle, including running billions of Monte Carlo simulations using \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/\"\u003eOracle Cloud Infrastructure\u003c/a\u003e (OCI) to explore the different scenarios and outcome probabilities before and during every Grand Prix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Due to all the simulations before the race even starts, it's very easy to adapt a different strategy during the race because everything is there, everything is prepared,\u0026rdquo; Verstappen says. \u0026ldquo;I think we definitely had a strategy edge over other teams.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarning both of the top F1 trophies is no small feat, and it illustrates the team\u0026rsquo;s innovation and its embrace of data and technology to drive results. In addition to simulations for on-the-track action, Oracle technology supports Oracle Red Bull Racing\u0026rsquo;s launch of The Paddock fan engagement platform and the early stages of Red Bull Powertrain\u0026rsquo;s development of a new race engine, due to debut in 2026.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It's been an incredible season, so many highs, so many amazing performances,\u0026rdquo; says Christian Horner, team principal and CEO for Oracle Red Bull Racing. \u0026ldquo;As a team, we\u0026rsquo;ve really delivered on and off the track this season, and that relies very heavily on the technology partners that play a key role in this championship success.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e","story_results":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor Oracle Red Bull Racing, the focus on technical innovation extends well beyond the grid. Using \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cx/marketing/customer-loyalty/\"\u003eOracle CrowdTwist Loyalty and Engagement\u003c/a\u003e, the team launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/projects/loyalty-programme\"\u003eThe Red Bull Racing Paddock\u003c/a\u003e, a platform that lets fans earn points to gain access to exclusive merchandise and digital downloads. Since its launch, The Red Bull Racing Paddock has grown its loyalty membership by more than 950%. The team has continued to add capabilities and content that keep fans engaged between races and during the off season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026#39;s hugely important to stay at the cutting edge of innovation as a team, and particularly with our fan base, which is ever growing,\u0026rdquo; says Horner. \u0026ldquo;With initiatives that we\u0026#39;ve introduced like The Paddock\u0026mdash;enabling our fans to get closer to the action, to the information, to the engagement with the team\u0026mdash;it\u0026rsquo;s giving us the ability to know who our fans are. It\u0026rsquo;s something that we take incredibly seriously, interacting with the lifeblood of our team, which is of course the fans.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking ahead, the team has committed to a goal that may be every bit as tough as winning another championship: Designing and manufacturing its own race engines. Such a move would\u0026rsquo;ve been unthinkable even a few years ago for a company not already in the automotive industry, but cloud-based access to high-performance computing resources has helped changed what\u0026rsquo;s possible for such sophisticated engineering. So when Honda decided to no longer develop F1 engines, Oracle Red Bull Racing took the bold decision to develop its own engine by the 2026 season. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026#39;ve recruited the talent, we\u0026#39;ve got the infrastructure, and very importantly, we have the tools,\u0026rdquo; Horner says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCloud infrastructure levels the playing field for companies that need computing power for advanced engineering such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. Designers of products from cars to coffeemakers to electronics use CFD tools during development, but it\u0026rsquo;s traditionally required massive investment in on-premises data centers, for technology that might only be used sporadically. OCI let Oracle Red Bull Racing engineers get up and running immediately on CFD-capable computing, with no overhead when that capacity isn\u0026rsquo;t in use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The speed that we operate at is so fast, and that\u0026#39;s where Oracle\u0026rsquo;s cloud technology has really enabled us\u0026mdash;not having to wait for a data center to be built on site has let us go from a clean sheet of paper to having an engine up and running within a 12-month period,\u0026rdquo; Horner says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn another front, Oracle Red Bull Racing also participates in the F1 Esports Series Pro Championship, which sees the world\u0026rsquo;s best sim racers competing for drivers and team championships. Oracle Red Bull Racing relies on OCI for processing real-time telemetry data from the simulated races, ingesting up to 130,000 data points a second during an Esports race. This data can be used in artificial intelligence and machine learning models to optimize team and driver performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeparately from the F1 team, Red Bull Advanced Technologies is working with Oracle AI experts on ways to \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/connect/post/red-bull-uses-oci-ai-for-training-future-racing-stars\"\u003euse AI running on OCI\u003c/a\u003e to help train the next generation of drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Our first season as Oracle Red Bull Racing has been a phenomenal journey,\u0026rdquo; says Horner. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026#39;ve benefited hugely from Oracle\u0026#39;s technology, whether it\u0026#39;s on the pit wall, designing a new engine, or engaging with our fans. Across all spectrums of the business, it\u0026#39;s been an incredibly rewarding year on and off the track working with Oracle.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n","facebook_url":null,"twitter_image_alt_text":null,"facebook_sitename":null,"story_top_products_portfolio":[{"id":"CORE86A94D28504D4AB2A32C4924A5EE5670","type":"SH-ProductDetail","typeCategory":"ContentType","name":"Oracle Cloud Infrastructure","description":"","slug":"1481790393690-oracle-cloud-infrastructure","language":"en-US","translatable":true,"createdDate":{"value":"2020-10-15T11:09:11.428Z","timezone":"UTC"},"updatedDate":{"value":"2023-04-04T17:22:02.346Z","timezone":"UTC"},"fileExtension":"contentItem","fields":{"overview":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003cp\u003eOracle Cloud Infrastructure offers autonomous operations, integrated security, and truly elastic, serverless services in our global public cloud regions or within your data center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRun crucial enterprise applications with high performance, scale, and availability while lowering your costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":null,"data_label":"oracle-cloud-infrastructure-product-detail","featured_content":[{"id":"CORE3A05B95102F7491BB16B644501D60FF3","type":"SH-PublicStory","typeCategory":"ContentType","name":"Toyota Motor","links":[]},{"id":"CORE3A9BF346E26E4377ADD11D63D0B2A2DA","type":"SH-PublicStory","typeCategory":"ContentType","name":"Red Bull Racing - Main Story","links":[]},{"id":"CORE0C924D3CE76546F4A58A8A682C3BCB10","type":"SH-PublicStory","typeCategory":"ContentType","name":"Aon customer story","links":[]}],"link":"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/","cta_buttons":null,"title":"Oracle Cloud Infrastructure","image_alt_text":null,"contacts":{"contacts":[]},"quotes":null},"mimeType":"contentItem","fileGroup":"contentItem","links":[]},{"id":"CORED5A9ADA35D054230A1AD9A6746951030","type":"SH-ProductDetail","typeCategory":"ContentType","name":"Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes","description":"","slug":"1481786328354-oracle-container-engine-for-kubernetes","language":"en-US","translatable":true,"createdDate":{"value":"2020-10-15T12:48:44.085Z","timezone":"UTC"},"updatedDate":{"value":"2020-10-17T10:40:56.915Z","timezone":"UTC"},"fileExtension":"contentItem","fields":{"overview":null,"image":null,"data_label":"oracle-container-engine-for-kubernete-product-detail","featured_content":null,"link":"https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/","cta_buttons":null,"title":"Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes","image_alt_text":null,"contacts":null,"quotes":null},"mimeType":"contentItem","fileGroup":"contentItem","links":[]},{"id":"CORE82F11960CF8C4559B542C8BE8577F82F","type":"SH-ProductDetail","typeCategory":"ContentType","name":"Oracle CrowdTwist Loyalty and Engagement","description":"","slug":"3000000748541-oracle-crowdtwist-loyalty-and-engagement","language":"en-US","translatable":true,"createdDate":{"value":"2021-08-17T19:11:57.601Z","timezone":"UTC"},"updatedDate":{"value":"2021-08-17T19:11:57.601Z","timezone":"UTC"},"fileExtension":"contentItem","fields":{"overview":null,"image":null,"data_label":null,"featured_content":null,"link":"https://www.oracle.com/cx/marketing/customer-loyalty/","cta_buttons":null,"title":"Oracle CrowdTwist Loyalty and Engagement","image_alt_text":null,"contacts":null,"quotes":null},"mimeType":"contentItem","fileGroup":"contentItem","links":[]}],"meta_description":"The Drivers and Constructors’ World Championship F1 team expands its technology partnership, using Oracle Cloud for real-time race simulations, fan engagement, engine development, and more.","story_hero_image":{"id":"CONTBD61CFFDDE35404CB9F513CDE2070DA0","type":"DigitalAsset","typeCategory":"DigitalAssetType","name":"redbull-hero-banner2.jpg","fileExtension":"jpg","links":[]},"story_hero_image_alt_text":null,"headquarters":null,"partner_link_url":null,"eyebrow_text":null,"story_summary":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Drivers and Constructors\u0026rsquo;

change the way the world buys, sells, owns, and\u0026nbsp;uses vehicles. The Atlanta-based company was formed in 2014 to consolidate more\u0026nbsp;than 25 global automotive businesses it\u0026nbsp;acquired\u0026nbsp;over the years\u0026mdash;including Autotrader,\u0026nbsp;vAuto,\u0026nbsp;Kelley Blue Book, and Manheim\u0026nbsp;\u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;under one brand.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an\u0026nbsp;unrivaled view across the data-driven automotive industry ecosystem, Cox\u0026nbsp;Automotive leverages its unmatched data sets to provide insights and create\u0026nbsp;services that help clients profitably run\u0026nbsp;their businesses. The company\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp;transparent data philosophy improves automotive experiences, increases\u0026nbsp;efficiencies, and automates decisions across a wide breadth of the automotive\u0026nbsp;industry, including auto dealers, consumers, lenders, and OEMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;All the acquisitions needed to create this automotive information engine had a risk, however, when it came to back-office operations, with disparate applications and on-premises data centers making it difficult to connect businesses or add new capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We needed to move into the cloud so we could provide more holistic service to our end users,\u0026rdquo; says Maria Riley, vice president of corporate systems at Cox Automotive. \u0026ldquo;To do this, we needed a cohesive back-office infrastructure.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCox Automotive uses a multicloud approach with a simple strategy: tap the right cloud for the job. As part of the strategy to rationalize technologies and build an engineering ecosystem, Cox Automotive has extensively leveraged other cloud providers for software product engineering. For its back-office infrastructure, the company more recently implemented \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/\"\u003eOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\u003c/a\u003e to run several high-volume, back-office enterprise applications. One application running on OCI provides a real-time transaction engine that\u0026rsquo;s essentially the cash register for the wholesale vehicle marketplace at Manheim, a Cox Automotive business, while another provides the consolidated financial platform used across Cox Automotive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The capability to run the workloads that we have (on OCI) literally doesn't exist anywhere else,\u0026rdquo; says Robert Taylor, lead back-office architect at Cox Automotive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eMoving auctions to the cloud\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCox Automotive began its digital transformation efforts with the billing and revenue functions of Manheim, which is the world\u0026rsquo;s largest wholesale auto auction based on trade volume. In recent years, the company used on-premises versions of Oracle E-Business Suite to individually manage the billing and cash functions for more than 100 physical, digital, and mobile auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We wanted to modernize and centralize all those billing and settlement activities,\u0026rdquo; says Riley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of Manheim\u0026rsquo;s digital transformation efforts, the highly customized back-office applications were moved to EBS. \u0026ldquo;We decided at the time to partner with Oracle to run the billing and revenue systems in their private cloud that had dedicated infrastructure with managed services,\u0026rdquo; says Riley. \u0026ldquo;This was the first leg of our modernization journey. Moving to OCI and the public cloud infrastructure was the next step where we fully leveraged the cloud to automate almost all of the activities the managed services were providing us. We also significantly improved the architecture to enable higher availability and the flexibility to scale up and down with our business needs.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning several Oracle products such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/applications/ebusiness/\"\u003eOracle E-Business Suite\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/business-intelligence/technologies/bi-enterprise-edition.html\"\u003eOracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/industries/financial-services/revenue-management-pricing/\"\u003eOracle Revenue Management and Billing\u003c/a\u003e on OCI using the capabilities of \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/cloud-service/\"\u003eOracle\u0026rsquo;s Exadata Cloud Service\u003c/a\u003e has already saved the company more than $4.5 million a year, according to Riley. And while it set the stage for modernization, Cox Automotive leaders saw that running enterprise apps on a fast, centralized cloud architecture created many opportunities beyond saving money. The cloud architecture enabled Cox Automotive use serverless capabilities such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/functions/\"\u003eOCI Functions\u003c/a\u003e to be more agile, flexible, and resilient. \u0026ldquo;We knew we could be more nimble in the cloud than we could ever be in the data center,\u0026rdquo; says Riley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCloud skills transfer\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Cox Automotive began moving its applications to OCI, it tapped internal expertise running the customer-facing applications on other cloud providers to join the team. This accelerated the implementation of OCI by leveraging years of experience with cloud infrastructure while embedding governance and security to protect the company. Tight collaboration with Oracle\u0026rsquo;s cloud specialists also proved essential to success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Oracle team worked closely with us to solve problems,\u0026rdquo; Taylor says. \u0026ldquo;The access we had to Oracle executives and product teams at the beginning was huge. We have very strong relationships with Oracle, and that\u0026rsquo;s been invaluable.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing OCI to deploy infrastructure as code, Cox Automotive\u0026rsquo;s back-office development team has reduced the time it takes to put newly generated code into production, from two-and-a-half weeks to three days. The accelerated timeline includes automation of QA and lower lifecycle management. OCI created the flexibility and scalability that Cox Automotive needed to advance its infrastructure to build new applications faster and more efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, Cox Automotive\u0026rsquo;s auditor recently asked to install software on its Oracle E-Business Suite so it can pull the data it needs to complete company audits, but that was creating performance issues and security concerns. Using an infrastructure-as-code approach, Cox Automotive quickly built a new piece of code that allows the auditor to tap into the company\u0026rsquo;s system once a quarter to pull the data needed, instead of maintaining the service year-round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePoised for the future\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the cost savings, agility, and reliability gains, the IT modernization at Cox Automotive also means that IT leadership can focus on business goals rather than making dated and disparate financial systems work together. And that motivates tech teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving to the cloud and adopting an agile approach have also fundamentally changed the way the back office works. That agility is critical as Cox Automotive drives change in the auto business, including completing additional acquisitions as part of an effort to further expand the business. Because the company now has a common, cloud-based technology \u0026ldquo;backbone,\u0026rdquo; new acquisitions can quickly transact and communicate with established areas of the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Those acquisitions are going to come in all shapes and sizes,\u0026rdquo; says Riley. \u0026ldquo;The goal is they will all be integrated. Our Oracle platforms are key to that integration path.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e","partner_name":null,"story_theme":null,"facebook_image":null,"facebook_type":null,"hero_attribution_text":null,"customer_logo_black":{"id":"CONTF4F815B0FE794CE288310483DB709636","type":"DigitalAsset","typeCategory":"DigitalAssetType","name":"customerlogo-cox-automotive-blk.svg","fileExtension":"svg","links":[]},"sa_created_story":null,"story_customer_logo_alt_text":null,"facebook_locale":null,"story_card_image":null,"technical_case_study_cta":null,"robots":"index

Among its most notable brands are: Planters, SKIPPY, SPAM, Hormel Natural Choice, Applegate, Justin\u0026rsquo;s, Wholly, Hormel Black Label and Columbus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the company continues to make strategic acquisitions, it has acquired different IT systems. \u0026ldquo;We had various systems for various companies that did not interface well together,\u0026rdquo; Sheehan says. \u0026ldquo;They did not provide us with a clear view of the company\u0026#39;s performance, were difficult to maintain, and honestly, had become a burden to our competitiveness.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, the human capital management (HCM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications hadn\u0026rsquo;t been upgraded in over 15 years. Some systems depended on a single person\u0026mdash;\u0026ldquo;whoever remained who understood the code it was written on,\u0026rdquo; Sheehan says. Adding to the complexity, Hormel Foods had customized many of its applications to meet the needs of individual brands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the company tackled these challenges, its goal wasn\u0026rsquo;t just to even the playing field. \u0026ldquo;We wanted to be in the lead,\u0026rdquo; Sheehan says. \u0026ldquo;We were trying to make a generational shift and leapfrog our competitors.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eFull steam ahead\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"float: left; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Hormel Foods is nuts about Oracle\" src=\"https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/img/rc38-hormel.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, Hormel Foods launched Project Orion, a strategic and sweeping effort to modernize its core business systems. Having worked with Oracle since 1998, the company tapped Oracle and partner \u003ca href=\"https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home.html\"\u003eKPMG\u003c/a\u003e to move to cloud-based HCM, ERP, and its One Supply Chain systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We felt like Oracle had the right cloud strategy,\u0026rdquo; Vaupel says. \u0026ldquo;Besides offering a fusion cloud environment, where cloud systems are well integrated, Oracle is committed to continuously updating its technologies. We now get quarterly upgrades for every application, which lets us take advantage of new efficiencies, plus ensure our systems are as secure as they need to be.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHormel Foods went live with \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/\"\u003eOracle Fusion Cloud HCM\u003c/a\u003e in January 2020 and \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/erp/\"\u003eFusion Cloud ERP\u003c/a\u003e in June as well as \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/performance-management/\"\u003eOracle Cloud EPM\u003c/a\u003e. Later, the IT team began phasing in \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/scm/\"\u003eOracle Supply Chain Management Cloud\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/integration/\"\u003eOracle Integration and Migration\u003c/a\u003e, an \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/cloud/\"\u003eOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\u003c/a\u003e service, was used to quickly connect applications and data. The timing was, well, interesting: Hormel Foods forged ahead with its modernization despite being in the middle of a global pandemic. \u0026ldquo;We had to rely on teamwork,\u0026rdquo; says Assistant Controller Eldon Quam. \u0026ldquo;We had Oracle, KPMG, and Hormel Foods people all working together. If you weren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with the group, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have known the difference between a Hormel Foods person and someone who worked for another company.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe collaboration paid off. Last summer, Hormel Foods saw its first partially automated financial close go smoothly. Ditto for moving purchasing processes to the cloud, despite the major external turmoil in global supply chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore than anything, Hormel Foods gained a single platform\u0026mdash;one source of truth. \u0026ldquo;We have visibility into every business from the same point of view,\u0026rdquo; Sheehan says. \u0026ldquo;When our brands report, whether it\u0026rsquo;s their cash flow, their income statement, or their balance sheet items, they are all presented the same way. When we look at our employee base, we now see the totality, not just 70 percent of employees, with different information on the other 30 percent.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe power of one\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/\"\u003eOracle Analytics\u003c/a\u003e, Hormel Foods has built a forecasting model to pinpoint growth opportunities across its many brands. \u0026ldquo;In the past, we looked at things brand by brand,\u0026rdquo; says Jana Haynes, vice president and controller. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s still important to do, but now that we\u0026rsquo;re on a centralized platform, we\u0026rsquo;re able to notice things that weren\u0026rsquo;t apparent before.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne example: Hormel Foods is forecasting strong sales throughout its food service brands, which market to restaurants, hotels, and other food service operators. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re factoring this into everything from operations to demand planning,\u0026rdquo; Sheehan says. \u0026ldquo;As the economy recovers and restaurants reopen, the last thing you want is a product shortage in a channel where demand is strong.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHormel Foods has a similar bird\u0026rsquo;s-eye view of global procurement data. With all procurement except for China and Brazil now on Oracle Cloud, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to analyze vendors. For instance, the company discovered that some of its brands paid more than others for the same item. Another nugget: the number of vendors that are the sole source of items its brands rely on. Knowing this allows the company to explore alternative sources and be ready should a vendor prove unable to meet demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This type of analysis yields a competitive advantage,\u0026rdquo; Sheehan says. \u0026ldquo;It helps us be forward-thinking and make smarter decisions.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA 130-year-old innovative,

Having so many pieces from one cloud fit Xerox\u0026rsquo;s strategic goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We wanted to keep these solutions all in the family, so to speak,\u0026rdquo; says Sreedhar Vaidyanathan, vice president, digital transformation. \u0026ldquo;This avoids the headaches of too many vendors and platforms. Oracle\u0026rsquo;s solutions make it simple for our new businesses to roll up to the mother ship, and vice versa. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to track performance.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there\u0026rsquo;s one performance metric that\u0026rsquo;s more key than others: speed to market.

With 3D printing, customers can order spare parts locally, or even manufacture parts themselves, instead of ordering from far-flung, cross-ocean sources. This capability speeds up delivery and reduces the impact of supply chain disruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn late 2020, the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, installed a Xerox ElemX 3D Printer, to explore manufacturing parts at sea. The goal is to install a printer on a Navy ship, so sailors in remote areas can fix or replace parts on demand instead of carrying excess inventory or having to send a plane to the middle of the ocean to bring the spare parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back office, by automating processes such as procure-to-pay and quote-to-cash, the Xerox 3D printing team \u0026ldquo;gained the ability to transact right out of the gate,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no waiting to generate invoices and start collecting revenue, and we\u0026rsquo;re able to scale as much as needed. We can replicate this process for any new venture. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to implement a different platform every time we launch.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Xerox businesses grow, Oracle Cloud EPM consolidates and connects data to help the company evaluate financial performance across the portfolio. \u0026ldquo;We can look under the hood to see how each business is doing, and compare it to other units,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;What do their financials look like? Are they in compliance? We have clear lines of sight.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTackling business and societal problems with innovation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe same Oracle solutions power Xerox\u0026rsquo;s software business, \u003ca href=\"https://carear.com/\"\u003eCareAR\u003c/a\u003e, which launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.news.xerox.com/news/Xerox-announces-formation-of-CareAR-software-business\"\u003eearlier this year\u003c/a\u003e. Using augmented reality (AR) technologies, the CareAR service experience management (SXM) platform enables field service teams to provide remote customer support. Equipped with visual tools and access to data, field technicians can work remotely to help customers solve problems faster and skip costly on-site visits. For equipment owners, receiving expert guidance is as easy as using your cell phone, tablet, or smart glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEqually innovative is \u003ca href=\"https://eloque.com/\"\u003eEloque\u003c/a\u003e, Xerox\u0026rsquo;s joint venture with the Victorian government in Australia. Xerox developed technology that remotely monitors bridges, drawing on deep experience in sensors, analytics, and artificial intelligence to bring the physical world online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure the structural integrity of bridges, tiny fiber optic sensors are attached to measure and estimate structural strain, thermal response, bending, loads, vibrations, and corrosion, which are all indicators of structural health. When sensors detect a problem, field technicians are automatically alerted to investigate. Such real-time responses let bridge operators and owners decide whether a bridge is being over- or underutilized, or has structural problems that need repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a key partner supporting Xerox, Oracle \u0026ldquo;has come up with a lot of creative ideas to keep things moving forward,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve been instrumental in our journey.\u0026rdquo; As Xerox brings more breakthrough technologies to market via these new businesses, Oracle Cloud will continue to be an important platform for these ambitious new ventures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;If someone has a greenlighted idea, they can come to us today and tomorrow we\u0026rsquo;ll give them the basic toolset,\u0026rdquo; he says.
