Janoska outlines a dilemma common to many of the people who got out in time. \"Yeah, sure, suddenly you can go and sail around the world,\" he says. \"But then you learn very quickly that there are very few people out there to sail around the world with.\" There is a point when becoming a member of the idle rich is, well, a yawn. \"After a few months,\" says Janoska, \"your mind goes idle.\""},{"_id":"MG2NGLZTDRDF3N6MX4BQU26HK4","type":"text","additional_properties":{},"content":"(3)Giving away money is more difficult than you think"},{"_id":"GTL4XUIWEBAFBHAELM3YHV2QDQ","type":"text","additional_properties":{},"content":"To combat ennui, some of the newly rich devote themselves to eliminating its cause: their wealth. Take the case of Hamilton's Joyce Young. In the early '90s, she was badgered by her computer-geek nephew, Robert, to invest in a company he and a few friends were starting in the United States.

Not because they're unwilling to give it away; rather, these payoff-obsessed individuals say it's difficult to find organizations worthy of funding. To their eye, traditional charities are appallingly inefficient. The ideal? A company that simultaneously makes money and makes the world a better place. Failing that, they want to make donations that will produce big change. They've sparked a remarkable spate of charitable innovation, such as Canadian eBay co-founder Jeffrey Skoll's 2002 donation of $475,000 to a Kenyan non-profit that develops cheap agricultural equipment.

The companies he funded, Young decided, would one day have to break even, independent of donations. His team identified 40 potential companies across Canada, then started narrowing the field by considering factors such as accountability and the public good. They ended up donating to none of them."},{"_id":"7O454ZMFGZAYZFWKRBNRBM57RU","type":"text","additional_properties":{},"content":"Young then decided that if such hybrid companies were so difficult to find, he would help entrepreneurs create some.

In his former life at Janna Systems-where he was Boswell the helicopter pilot's boss-Tatham used to get invited by business schools to impart his wisdom to students. He developed a routine for these performances. He'd laser-point his way through a few slides, and before too long he'd present his audience with a question. \"Why do we work?\" he'd ask. He'd stop and survey the audience's eager, wrinkle-free faces, watching the ambitious young men and women process the question. Then he'd toss out some possible answers: \"Is it because I like the challenge?

The pace of his working life was insane; two years ago he was 40 pounds heavier and strung out from building his company into the world leader in its niche, customer relationship management software. Because Janna Systems catered to large financial institutions, such as investment banks, Tatham typically spent one day a week in New York, and another in Chicago; he usually had to work weekends. A good thing his Toronto place was just a block and a half from the Janna headquarters. \"It was a very drop-out-of-society sort of lifestyle,\" says Tatham. \"I'd like to think most days I made it home in time to kiss my kids goodnight.

In turn, Siebel paid Janna the ultimate compliment: It pitched Tatham on a takeover. \"The value was far larger than I had ever set as a target,\" he recalls.
