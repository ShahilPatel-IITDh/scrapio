           Dear Friend,
          </p>
          <p>
           Everything that happens to one has spiritual significance. I was 
              just leafing through the profiles of some names in the internet 
              before I came through your name. Though, the internet has been grossly 
              abused by scam artist and miscreants whose intention is to hurt. 
              In as much as one should be careful, same time we should not allow 
              negative to kill the positive potential in a realistic business. 
              I have chosen to reach you because I felt that business is taking 
              risk, going from the known to the unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am the manager of Accounts / Operations Department of our bank 
              here in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire. In my department we discovered an 
              abandoned sum of ( US$16.5,million US dollars ) in an account that 
              belongs to one of our foreign customer retired Atlanta physician 
              Mr.George Brumley Jr,who die in Kenya Airways crash in the coasts 
              of Abidjan in which all passengers on board died. Since then I have 
              made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients 
              extended relatives but has been unsuccessful.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since we got information about his death,we have been expecting 
              his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
              release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation 
              to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but 
              unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation 
              died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind 
              for the claim.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make 
              this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
              next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
              disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this 
              money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned 
              by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Ivoirienne 
              cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 50 % of 
              this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn 
              account, While 50% will be for me Thereafter,
          </p>
          <p>
           All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this 
              deal through I guarantee that this will be executed under all legitimate 
              arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. In 
              your reply mail, I want you to give me your full names, address, 
              date of birth, telephone and fax numbers. If you can handle this 
              with me,

          <p>
           Thanking you for your anticipated cooperation

           Dearest in christ Jesus ,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           My name is Mrs. Susan Najao a nationality of Kuwait. I am married 
              to late Mr. JAMES NAJAO who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory 
              Coast for nine years before he died in the year Octorber 2003. We 
              were married for twenty years with a child. He died after an illness 
              that lasted for four days. Please I know this may come to you by 
              supprise , because you did not know me, I needed your assistance 
              that was why I write you through divine direction, it is my desire 
              of going into relationship with you.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Before his death we were both born again Christians.When my late 
              husband was alive we deposited the sum of (Ten Million U.S.Dollars) 
              with one of good banks here in Cote d'Ivoire Presently, this money 
              is still with the bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would 
              not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem,Though 
              what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I 
              decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian 
              individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct 
              here in.I want a person or church that will use this fund to churches,orphanages, 
              research centres and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure 
              that the house of God is maintained.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. 
              I took this decision because I have a child that will inherit this 
              money but my son can not carry out this work only because i and 
              my late husband decide to use some of the money to work for God 
              and live some for our son to have a better live.our son is just 
              17year old now and been grow up in africa, he have low manterity 
              and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I don't want my 
              family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers,I don't want 
              a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.Hence 
              the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death 
              hence I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 
              14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold 
              my peace.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           I will like you to understand that my contact to you is a divine 
              direction from God , I don't want any of my husband family relatives 
              to recieve this money but I know that With God all things are possible. 
              As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of 
              the Finance/bank. I will also issue you a letter of authority that 
              will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you 
              and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. 
              My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian.Whoever 
              that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth,Please 
              always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply 
              will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual 
              for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly 
              as I stated here and Please I will like you to contact me Immediately 
              you receive this mail so that I will instruct the Bank to transfer 
              this fund into your account for me and my Son to start coming over 
              there before the end of this year.
          </p>

           Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

           My Will Assistance 
              Calvary greetings, I decided to contact you for friendship and assistance 
              and distribution of my inheritances I have to say that I have no 
              intentions of causing you any Pains so I decided to contact you 
              through this medium humbly ask that you to take due consideration 
              of its importance and immense benefit and also sincerely seek your 
              confidence, as I make this Proposal to you as a person of integrity. 
              I got your contact through Network online internet search in my 
              personal search for a reliable and reputable individual to handle 
              a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of $5.5Million 
              US Dollars. I decided to write you. As you read this, I don't want 
              you to feel sorry for me, because, I Believe everyone will die someday. 
              My name is Sarah May Allport I am a dying woman who have decided 
              to donate what I have to you/ church/charity Organizations. I was 
              diagnosed with esophageal Cancer for about 7 Years ago; I am married 
              to Sir Gerald Allport who worked with British Judicial Commission 
              in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July 
              in the year 1989. We were married for fifteen years without a child 
              and he has left me everything he worked for. I have not particularly 
              lived my life so well, as I never really cared For anyone. Though 
              I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people 
              and only focus on my self as that was the only thing I Cared for. 
              But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life 
              than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I 
              believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world 
              again I would live my life a different way from how I have lived 
              it. Now that I know My time is near I have been touched by God to 
              donate from what I have Inherited from my late husband for the good 
              work of God, rather than Allow my relatives to use my husband hard 
              earned funds ungodly. So far, I have distributed money to some charity 
              organizations in the U.A.E, London and Ireland. Now that my health 
              has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I 
              once asked members of my family to Close one of my accounts and 
              donate the money, which I have there to Charity organization in 
              Bulgaria; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, 
              I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with 
              what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge 
              Cash deposit that I have with Financial Firm Abroad .I will want 
              you to Help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity 
              organizations And let them know that it is me Sarah May that is 
              making this Generous donation. I am writing this from my laptop 
              computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my time to come. I 
              pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart 
              Please pray that the good Lord forgives me my sins. I have asked 
              God to Forgive me and I believe he has because He is a merciful 
              God. I will be going in for an operation in less than few days. 
              I decided to WILL/donate the money to you for the good work of the 
              lord, And also to help the motherless and less privilege and also 
              for the Assistance of the widows according to (JAMES 1:27). I took 
              this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit 
              This money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping 
              poor Persons and I do not want my husband's hard earned money to 
              be misused Or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not 
              specify. At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now 
              due to the Fact that my relatives are around me and my health status. 
              I wish you all the best and May the good Lord blesses you abundantly 
              and please uses the funds well and always extends the good work 
              to others. NB: I will appreciate your ultmost confidentiality in 
              this matter until the task is accomplished as I don't want anything 
              that will jeopardize my last wish. Personal Email : sarrammy@aol.com

          <p>
           My name is Mr. Richard Moore, the transfer telegraphic officer 
              from LLOYDS TSB Bank Plc of London. I got your contact through Business 
              Online Network here in London, United Kingdom. Our bank, LLOYDS 
              TSB Bank of London received some funds from the Arabian Bank an 
              this fund is among the Multi Billion Dollars Contract awarded to 
              foreign firms in South Africa for refurbishing, reconstruction and 
              upgrading of Roads, stadium etc for the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup 
              in South Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
           In one of our periodic auditing, I discovered a dormant account 
              with a holding balance of USD5M (Five Million United States Dollars).This 
              account has been dormant since three years now and nobody was operating 
              on this account. This is why I decided to contact you for this transfer 
              of the said amount of USD5M (Five Million United States Dollars).The 
              total sum has already been paid to the contracting firm, Arab company 
              in Jordan leaving here in our custody an over-invoiced payment of 
              U$5M (Five Million United States Dollars) which nobody has come 
              for the claim since few years. I want you to assist me as a partner 
              to transfer this fund out of our bank, LLOYDS TSB Bank Plc Bank 
              of London to your account overseas under successful legitimate transfer 
              arrangement hence the bank is ever ready to remit to any company/individual 
              with useful information for this fund which I will provide for you.
          </p>

              and I will make a trip to your country for disbursement and investment 
              after the final transfer to your account. I am counting on your

           Guys,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           It is not sufficient to tell us about these scams... you should 
              be able to track this kind of things, at least the most of them. 
              You do have the knowledge and the means to prevent such situations.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Well, here goes one scam...

           Hello,
           <br/>
           Thanks for your mail and how was your day,am very happy to hear 
              from you,am very happy to hear that you you are taking the project 
              and let me know the price.I want to let you to know that the money 
              will be through cheque.I seek money from big organization and rich 
              people that are willing to help teenagers so they are going to mail 
              you the cheque and i just want to let you know before you proceed 
              if you are okay with it,Am ready to pay you the down payment of 
              50%.
           <br/>
           I share worry with young kids, teenagers, etc. Here in the US and 
              rest if the world the HIV virus, AIDS and some other sexually transmitted 
              diseases (via needles + drug uses + tattoo) are very predominant 
              in the older population as well (i.e. 50 and 60 years old) I created 
              a short film (very simple and funny) and placed onYouTube called 
              Beauty and the Beast. At www.Youtube.com Search for Belavida09 there 
              you can see this particular video.
           <br/>
           Here it is a link for you to see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNvEZIIQp7k
           <br/>
           I tried to help some big organizations and make a real movie regarding 
              this sort of problems, perhaps to show that the real world need 
              to be more careful and caring. But here, money and greed drives 
              everything capitalism is the key. Unfortunately it is a worldwide 
              problem the mindset to resolve this issues in the US and overseas 
              are set with very little funding.
          </p>

           Greetings !!!
          </p>
          <p>
           We have been waiting for you to contact me for your Trunk Box worth 
              $1,650,000.00 (One Million, Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand United 
              States Dollars), being compensation fund for 150 scam victims, but 
              I did not hear from you all this while.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have deposited the Trunk Box with FEDEX COURIER SERVICE, West 
              Africa, I traveled out of the country for a 3 Months Course and 
              I will not be back until completion of my 3 months course. What 
              you have to do now is to contact the FEDEX COURIER SERVICE immediately 
              to know when they will deliver your consignment to you because of 
              the expiring date.
          </p>
          <p>
           For your information, I have paid for the delivery Charge, Insurance 
              premium and Clearance Certificate Fee of the consignment showing 
              that it is not a Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorism attack 
              in your Country. The only money you will send to the FEDEX COURIER 
              SERVICE to deliver your Trunk Box direct to your postal Address 
              in your country is US$185 only being Security Keeping Fee of the 
              Courier Company so far. Again, don't be deceived by anybody to pay 
              any other money except US$185.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would have paid that but they refused, because they don't know 
              when you will contact them and in case of demurrage. You have to 
              contact the FEDEX COURIER SERVICE now for the delivery of your Trunk 
              Box with this information below:

           Firstly I must introduce myself as Sr.Christobal J. an attorney 
              to Josй Antonio Roca, the former town planner and Marbella 's power 
              broker of Marbella in the Andalucia region of Spain . Though he's 
              presently standing trial for corruption, embezzlement of state funds 
              and sales of states properties amounting 80 Million Euro. Be advised 
              to visit the following links to be better acquainted with the current 
              corrupt situation in Spain .

          </p>
          <p>
           In the interim, he’s being probed for misappropriation of state 
              fund, to this end approximately 12, 800 000.00 Euro (Twelve Million 
              Eight Hundred Thousand Euro) as part money from the misappropriated 
              state fund, was lodged into a private /discrete financial outfit 
              here in EUROPE . Already he had notified me to recruit a foreign 
              corporate body/individual under whose identity the funds will be 
              transferred out of Europe . For your benefit of doubt, the terms 
              are to re-profile the entire identity of the funds under your ownership, 
              corporate or individual.
          </p>
          <p>
           Really and truly I will prefer an experienced business personnel/company 
              body that can profitably invest these funds productively outside 
              the continent of Europe . Also I would like you to give this project 
              utmost confidential approach.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           [1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
           <br/>
           [2]. Receive the funds into a business/private bank account.
           <br/>

           Hi,
           <br/>
           How are you?. My name is Sheila and I am working with a Humanitarian 
              Aid Organization in Al-Anbar province of Iraq. Our main work is 
              to establish adequate Educational institutions and health care centre 
              for the internally displaced people in the rural areas.
           <br/>
           I got your address from a universal contact directory hence I decided 
              to write to you personal for an urgent discussion if you don`t mind.
           <br/>
           My main reason for writing to you is that I need your help urgently. 
              I am planning to resign from my job due to security risk in this 
              area therefore I want to know if you would be interested to help 
              me secure some funds which I want to move out of Iraq as quick as 
              possible
           <br/>
           The total amount is 2.7 million USD (TWO MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND 
              US DOLLARS) and I need a reliable partner out side Iraq who can 
              assist me in the process therefore I want to know if you can be 
              able to help me secure this money in your country on my behalf until 
              I come and collect it back with out having any problem with you.
           <br/>
           Actually I do not know you in person to trust you enough but I hope 
              you can prove to me that you are reliable, and can handle this transaction 
              competently. There is no risk involved because I will arrange how 
              to move the fund to your country through a very safe way but Can 
              I trust you?. Are you going to keep this money intact for me until 
              I come and get it back from you?.
           <br/>
           I will offer you 15% of the total amount if you would accept to 
              assist me in this process and also I would like you to suggest any 
              profitable venture in which I can invest some part of the money 
              so that I will have a source of income after my resignation.
           <br/>
           Thank you very much and God bless you. I am looking forward to hearing 
              from you soon.
           <br/>
           Please ignore this message if you are not interested.

              recently my doctor inform me i have a few weeks to live due to the 
              esophageal cancer. I have not particularly lived my life so well, 
              as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. 
              Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile 
              to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing 
              I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there 
              is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money 
              in the world. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, 
              as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. The 
              last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit 
              of fifteen million dollars $15, 000, 000,00 that I have with a finance/Security 
              Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit 
              and dispatched it to charity organizations. I! t may interest you 
              to know that i

              customer,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           PayPal is constantly working to ensure security by regularly screening 
              the accounts in our system. We have recently determined that different 
              computers have tried logging into your PayPal account,and multiple 
              password failures were present before the logons.
          </p>
          <p>
           Until we can collect secure information, your access to sensitive 
              account features will be limited. We would like to restore your 
              access as soon as possible, and we apologize for the inconvenience.
          </p>
          <p>
           Why is my account access limited?
          </p>
          <p>
           Your account access has been limited for the following reason:
          </p>
          <p>
           June 13, 2010: We have reasons to believe that your account has 
              been accessed by a third party from the following IP: 193.127.2.21.
           <br/>
           Therefore, we have limited access to sensitive account features 
              until we can confirm your identity. We understand that having limited 
              access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your account is our 
              primary concern.
          </p>
          <p>
           (Your case ID for this reason is PP-687-4215-01.)
          </p>
          <p>
           How can I restore my account access?
          </p>

          <p>
           Good day:
          </p>
          <p>
           My name is authur smith and I work for DHL COURIER COMPANY HERE 
              IN CANADA
           <br/>
           I am in custudy of a parcel that contains a bank draft wort 1.5million 
              united states dollars,that belongs to you.
          </p>
          <p>
           The parcel was delivered to the DHL BRANCH OFFICE were I work as 
              the manager,this parcel was on it way to your destination and it 
              was been sent from ABUJA NIGERIA,the reason why the delivery of 
              the parcel was not been completed to your destination was that ,the 
              parcel has been ordered from the head offcie DHL NIGERIA AND ALSO 
              LONDON to be stoped due to the reason that the tax CLEARANCE fees 
              has not yet been settled by the SENDER AND all our effort to locate 
              him or her has been in vain,so we reasoned that it will be better 
              to contact you the receiver,since your sender left with us your 
              information and also your email address to be incontact with you 
              on delivery of the parcel to you,So parcel was stoped because according 
              to the dhl office in nigeria that any funds leaving there country 
              that is above 200,000.00usd must have the tax clearance fees settled 
              other it will be taged as illegal funds.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I have been instructed not to proceed with the delivery as 
              at yet because you will need to acquire a form ,that will be submited 
              to the TAX CLEARANCE HEAD OFFICE IN ABUJA NIGERIA before the parcel 
              can be released from my office to you.
          </p>
          <p>
           So before your parcel will proceed from canada to your destination 
              ,you have been asked to send to them the total of 190usd ,in other 
              for them to help acquire the form for the tax clearance and also 
              have it submited and afterwords you will have your parcel forwarded 
              to you again.
          </p>
          <p>
           You are required to send the total of 190usd to them in nigeria,as 
              soon as you see this email to the information bellow via western 
              union.

           Dear Friend,
          </p>
          <p>
           I am Musa Zeh Blah former President of Liberia. I am contacting 
              you to assist me in receiving my money in the amount of Five million 
              united states dollars that is presently in a trust deposit abroad.

           I am currently under house arrest as a result of uncompleted probe 
              of our past administration by the Truth and reconciliation committee 
              that was set up by the present government in Liberia. Things got 
              worse when my private vault in my village was Raided last month 
              by the government where $18,000,000.00 that was recovered from me 
              by the Liberia Government.

              I can trust to receive and invest the five million dollars on my 
              behalf. The funds in question do not have any connection with my 
              name so do not bother about any traces of you being involved with 
              money from me because my trust attorney will handle the transaction 
              with my name surfacing at any point. My trust attorney will conduct 
              legal transfer of beneficiary to your name to enable you receive 
              the money,
          </p>
          <p>
           The money will be invested by you and you will be entitled to 25% 
              of the share capital while 75% will be for me.Reply with your full 
              names, age, occupation and direct mobile number so that I will furnish 
              my lawyer with same so that he will contact you in actualizing my 
              proposition.
          </p>
