Poshmark may, in addition to any other rights it may have at law or in equity, terminate these Program Terms immediately and without prior notice if Independent Affiliate refuses to or is unable to perform the Services or is in breach of any material provision of these Program Terms. Independent Affiliate may terminate these Program Terms if Poshmark is in material breach of these Program Terms and does not cure such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice thereof. Upon any termination of these Program Terms, all rights and duties of the parties toward each other shall cease, except that the following Sections shall survive: 2 (with respect to any Affiliate Fees accrued during the term of these Program Terms but not yet paid); 3, 5(a) (but not the right to use the Marks), 5(b), and 6 through 12 (inclusive) (as well as the surviving terms from the Poshmark Terms of Service). <br></p><p><b><u>Independent Contractor; No Agency</u></b><br></p><p> Nothing in these Program Terms shall in any way be construed to render Independent Affiliate to be or to be construed as an agent, employee or representative of Poshmark. Independent Affiliate is and shall perform the Services hereunder as an independent contractor. Independent Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that Independent Affiliate is obligated to report as income all compensation received by Independent Affiliate pursuant to these Program Terms; and Independent Affiliate agrees to pay, and acknowledges the obligation to pay, all self-employment and other taxes thereon, including without limitation all federal and state income tax, social security taxes and unemployment, disability insurance and workers’ compensation applicable to Independent Affiliate and (if applicable) any person (including any employee of Independent Affiliate) who performs the Services; and that Independent Affiliate will not be eligible for any employee benefits (nor does he/she desire any of them) and expressly waives any entitlement to such benefits. Independent Affiliate further disclaims any intention or right to participate in any of Poshmark’s employee benefit plans or perquisites even if Independent Affiliate’s status with Poshmark is determined by a court, arbitrator or other third party tribunal to that of an employee. Independent Affiliate further agrees to indemnify Poshmark and hold it harmless to the extent of any obligation imposed on Poshmark (i) to pay withholding taxes or similar items or (ii) resulting from Independent Affiliate’s being determined not to be an independent contractor. Except insofar as it would preclude the Independent Affiliate from providing the Services in accordance with these Program Terms or would violate any obligation, restriction or covenant of Independent Affiliate under these Program Terms, Independent Affiliate is free to perform services for any other person or entity. Independent Affiliate further acknowledges and agrees to the following: <br></p><ul> <ol type=\\"a\\"> <li>While providing the Services, Independent Affiliate is, and shall at all times be and remain, an independent contractor; </li><li> Nothing in these Program Terms or otherwise shall be construed as identifying Independent Affiliate as an employee, agent or legal representative of Poshmark or any of Poshmark’s related or affiliated entities during the term for any purpose whatsoever; </li><li> Independent Affiliate is not authorized to transact business, incur obligations, sell goods, receive payments, solicit orders or assign or create any obligation of any kind, express or implied, on behalf of Poshmark or any of Poshmark’s related or affiliated entities, or to bind in any way whatsoever, or to make any promise, warranty or representation on behalf of Poshmark or any of Poshmark’s related or affiliated entities with respect to any matter, except as expressly authorized in writing by Poshmark; </li><li> While Independent Affiliate may receive, from time to time, instruction on the objects and goals for which he or she is responsible, Poshmark has no right to control the manner in which Independent Affiliate performs the Services under these Program Terms and Independent Affiliate is free to perform the Services in the manner Independent Affiliate deems fit and in accordance with recognized standards for such services; and </li><li> If, at any time, Independent Affiliate’s status with Poshmark as an independent contractor changes or if Independent Affiliate is ever deemed to be an employee of Poshmark, each of the covenants set forth above and these Program Terms remain in full force and effect in its entirety until and unless it is replaced with a subsequent and superseding agreement. </li></ol> </ul> <br/><p><b><u>Equitable Relief</u></b><br></p><p> Independent Affiliate and Poshmark agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to measure and calculate Poshmark’s damages from any breach by Independent Affiliate of these Program Terms. Accordingly, Independent Affiliate and Poshmark agree that if Independent Affiliate breaches these Program Terms, Poshmark will have available, in addition to any other right or remedy available and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Poshmark Terms of Services, the right to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach and specific performance of Sections 3 through 6. Independent Affiliate and Poshmark further agree that no bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and Independent Affiliate and Poshmark, hereby consent to the issuances of such injunction and to the ordering of such specific performance. <br></p><p> INDEPENDENT AFFILIATE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE OR SHE HAS READ THESE PROGRAM TERMS CAREFULLY (INCLUDING THE POSHMARK TERMS OF SERVICE) AND UNDERSTANDS, ACCEPTS AND AGREES TO THE OBLIGATIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES UPON INDEPENDENT AFFILIATE WITHOUT RESERVATION. <br></p></div>"},"htmlTitle":"Posh Affiliate Terms & Conditions"},"shippingProviders":{"ca":"Canada Post","us":"USPS","au":"Sendle","in":"Our Shipping Partner","uk":"Royal Mail","purolator":"Purolator"},"payPalPayout":{"title":"Receive Your Earnings Safely","msg1":"Receive Your Earnings Safely.","msg2":"Your PayPal is not connected yet.
