     Now you know, how I look like: pale as a programmer. Well, that's mostly true, but this
year it definitely has something to do with the weather. Do you believe me?
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     This website is especially dedicated to programmers. As a programmer you will
find compilers for DOS like GCC, LCC and TCC and also GCC for Macintosh. You also
find Interpreters here like EiC for DOS, WINDOWS, MAC and ATARI and also Little-C
as well as Thetis-C for MAC. The last addition is the Frambuffer C-library fb for
the Linux console.
    </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      FB or FBLib is a Framebuffer library for use under the Linux console. It
can be used on any Linux system with a Framebuffer device. This means, it
can also be used on a Rasberry Pi.
     </p>
     <p>
      The library is a 2D-library. It has no mouse support yet. It comes with
a set of Mac screen fonts. It can draw antialiased and comes with many
example programs. Part of the library are three applications:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Viev: A viewer for bitmap and vector graphics.
      </li>
      <li>
       PScript: A PostScript like Interpreter for vector graphics.
      </li>
      <li>
       MD: A MD-viewer for the console with inline graphics.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     The library can be used as is. It can be simply downloaded and expanded to
your home/user directory into a single folder fb. In addition, a bin folder
also has to be installed. This includes a sh-script syn, which will set all
directories and adds syntax files for MC (midnight commander). Leave the
console and restart it. Now, everything is properly installed and can be
used right out o the box.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are the two archives:

     <img src="img/pellesc.gif"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     So lets start with the compilers. The first is LCC from David Hanson and
Christopher Fraser. LCC was originally written for UNIX (that's why I used
Metrowerks "X"-logo here), it is also available in several versions for WINDOWS
(LCCWIN32 and Pelles-C) and now it's available for 32bit DOS with DPMI.
    </p>
    <p>
     LCC is a retargetable ANSI-C compiler, running in protected mode. It's
partly compiled by GCC from DJGPP. This DOS version of LCC does not use GCC's
assembler AS, I changed it to use NASM, the Netwide Assembler.
    </p>
    <p>
     NASM's syntax is much easier to learn and it's a powerful assembler. You can
find many, many sources and examples for writing assembly code with NASM.
The linker is LD from GCC. LCC comes complete with ANSI-C header files and it
uses the GCC libraries libc.a and libm.a. This version also has a VESA graphics
library libg.a. The whole compiler system comes with full sources and can be
compiled with GCC very easily and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     I included lots of example files and a documentation. LCC is a stable and
reliable C-compiler. I tweaked the code generator of LCC, so that the
assembler output is now well formatted. LCC now compiler its assembler NASM.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a very good book available "A retargetable C Compiler: Design and
Implementation", written by Christopher Fraser and David Hanson
(Addison Wesley, 1995). This book includes the main parts of the source code
and explains in great detail the inner working of this C compiler.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The next ANSI-C compiler system was also made for UNIX by Fabrice Bellard.
It's the tiny C-compiler TCC. It is also available for windows and I used
the latest binaries, added a dpmi interface for DOS to TCC and also a VESA
graphics library (like the one for LCC). There is also another VESA library,
which is for 32 bit colors and it is implemented as a DLL, which runs
perfectly under DOS with the help of Japeth's HXDOS extender. This DOS
version of TCC also produces native Windows binaries (PEF format), which
can be run under DOS with the HXDOS extender.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the way, many Windows based development systems also run under DOS with
this HXDOS extender. I also have the CH interpreter and the main part of CINT
working on DOS. Seems a little bit like magic, but it's all possible with
this extender.
    </p>
    <p>
     The library is well documented and the compiler as well as its tools like
linker and librarian can be compiled with TCC itself. TCC is one of the
fastest compiler available. It can also compile directly into memory, avoiding
the production of an .exe file. TCC can also be used in shell scripts from
BASH or SH under DOS. TCC uses no external linker, it's all done from
inside the compiler. The last thing to mention is TCC's inline assembler, which
syntax (AT&amp;T) is identical to the one AS from GCC uses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like all other packages here, TCC comes with complete sources and
documentation. Also included is NASM, which can now be compiled by TCC itself
and can be used together with TCC for special assembler modules.
    </p>
    <p>
     The HXDOS extender is also included here, but I would recommend, that you
visit Japeth's own Website to inform yourself about his marvellous peace
of software.

     What is this EiC-Interpreter?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Let me begin with an actual foreword from Softintegration, the makers of the CH
interpreter:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>    SoftIntegration Announces Free C/C++ Interpreter Ch Student Edition 6.3
    June 16, 2011 SoftIntegration, Inc. has released free Ch Student Edition v6.3
    for students to learn computing and programming in C/C++ with a user-friendly
    interactive C/C++ interpreter.
</pre>
    <p>
     As you can see from this announcement, it's not out of date at all to deal
with the interpreting of languages. The chief of Softintegration is itself a
member of the C++ standard commitee, so he knows what he is doing. I have
a CH-licence for more then 5 years now and I can recommmend this interpreter
to everybody (WIN, MAC, UNIX).

     You could also visit the website at CERN laboratory in Switzerland:

       CINT Homepage
      </a>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     This is, what CERN's people have to say about CINT:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>    What is CINT?

    CINT is an interpreter for C and C++ code. It is useful e.g. for situations
    where rapid development is more important than execution time. Using an
    interpreter the compile and link cycle is dramatically reduced facilitating
    rapid development. CINT makes C/C++ programming enjoyable even for part-time
    programmers.

    CINT is written in C++ itself, with slightly less than 400,000 lines of code.
    It is used in production by several companies in the banking, integrated
    devices, and even gaming environment, and of course by ROOT, making it the
    default interpreter for a large number of high energy physicists all over the
    world.
</pre>
    <p>
     So why, you might ask is there another C Interpreter. Now, the answer is very
easy: because EiC (Extensible, interactive C-interpreter) is a tool for every
C programmer and it's one of the best and easiest learning tools I know. Many
educational insitutions like universities and others use interpreters to teach
programming languages. They are much better suited for this task then large
and complicated compiler systems. Interpreters help finding bugs, because they
can tell exactly, in which line an error occured. Especially for newcomers it's
important to get meaningful error messages, which compilers often fail to do.
Interpreters are also much more safe to use.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a working and solid peace of handmade software, made by Ed. Breen in the
ninetees and deloped by him until 2001 or so on his website. Then it was forgotten
by the most, but I decided to port it from it's original Unix systems (VAX,
Linux and so on) to other systems like DOS, MACOS, Atari, Windows. EiC is very
fast, it has it's own stack machine inside, but it depended on UNIX (POSIX
headers). So, I first cleaned it from these UNIX like headers and made it
compatible to all other systems, which did not have POSIX like standards, but
which had ANSI-C compilers available to make EiC work on their system. It took
me quite a long time, to manage this code tweaking but at the end I succeeded
and now you can use this interpreter on virtually all systems, including
Handhelds, Palmtops etc. The compilation process itself was also drastically
made easier and cleaner, only using normal make files (or batch files).
    </p>
    <p>
     EiC is a complete and clean ANSI-C Interpreter. The DOS version comes packed
with my VESA (LFB - linear framebuffer and protected mode) library. It uses one
of the best antialiasings available from
     <a href="http://jgt.akpeters.com/papers/Nelson97/" rel="noreferrer">
      Nelson
     </a>
     . It has also many
conio functions, an integrated expression parser, a powerful GIF viewer, a text
viewer with C syntax hightlighting and more than 180 examples for graphic and
text programming in C.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone who is interested in graphics programming or generally in C
programming should have a look at this package, it's a wonderful programming
system and absolutely easy and safe to use. EiC can't crash your machine,
it's an interpreter for protected mode DOS (max 4 GByte memory) and in rare
situations CTRL-C is the solution, which brings you safely back to your DOS
shell. EiC gives extensive help for error recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
     My simple aim was to produce something like a standard example library for
basic and advanced graphic algorithms as well as text based programs, which
should help people learn how to program in C. The programs itself uses an
internal help system to provide additional information.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole C-Interpreter system is about 4.5 MBytes in size and it is nicely
documented with TeX (EiC ANSI-C library and the graphics library).
All sources are included and the whole development systen is free for
everybody.

    <p>
     Here you find the actual version of the EiC-Interpreter for DOS and an extra
program from Japeth to accellerate the VESA graphics performance through some
not well kown Intel tricks (it's in the Intel hardware manuals). You can
download this doc as PDF from this site.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sources of VESAMTRR are included in the archive. Here is a small info about
this program:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>    VESAMTRR is a tool to set a MTRR for VESA LFB to memory type 01 (WC).
     This may increase video memory write speed on DOS for P3s and P4s.
     In a Windows DOS box it is usually already done by the video driver.
     For more technical information please read the intel manuals.

     This tool requires cpu ring 0 access, so it cannot run on WinXP/2k/NT or
     DOSEMU, and it isn't needed there either.
</pre>
    <p>
     On my (rather old Dell system) this program can speed up screen clearing from
formerly 23 ms to now only 6 ms. This is a rather astonishing speedup, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are also two iso-images for burning bootable CD's with EiC. They contain
EiC without sources, all other files are included. The first one (261) is for
1024x768 screensize and the other (263) is for 1280x1024 screens.The CD boots
DOS 7.1 and copies all files to a Ramdisk. You can work directly from that disk.
For easy use the Volkov commander is included as a DOS shell. You can simply hit
Return on a C-file and EiC is started with that file. An editor is also included
on the CD. In Windows you see the additional contents of the CD. It contains
the whole EiC package together with GCC for DOS. The DOS extender, used on
this CD is the very good HXDOS extender from Japeth. It conforms to the DPMI
specification 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those who don't have a program to make bootable CD'S, there's a link
below for a totally free and working software package to make Boot-CD's from
Bart's website. The program UNZIP.EXE can also be downloaded.

     The next EiC version is for Windows (95 -&gt; XP). It also has a VESA library,
but without the linear frame buffer access (forbidden by Microsoft) and with
some other hardware restrictions. So it is a library with bank switching.
I'm not a great Windows guru, so I don't know how to manage it to make the
mouse work under these restrictions. All other routines are very similar to the
DOS version or the Mac version. This version was compiled with MINGW,
which is a GCC distrubution for Windows that produces very compact exe files.
This GCC distribution is also included here for downloading.

    <p>
     For all of you, who are working with MACOS (Classic or 68k), here are two
versions of EiC for Apple's MPW development system, which is now freely
available on the internet. EiC for MPW is an ordinary MPW tool (PPC or 68k
available) and it includes a graphic library, with many Toolbox functions,
Nelson's high quality antialiasing and many more useful graphic functions
like Bezier curves and conics.
    </p>
    <p>
     To minimize troubles in compiling the Interpreter (it's already compiled,
so this is for the experienced users), I included a special version of
MPW-PPC. I don't want to tell you too much about the contents, but look
for yourself, it has much more than only GCC. Like for instance TeX for MPW,
Lout for MPW and Lua for MPW. Ghostscript is also included. To make
everything work smoothly, There is an additional archive with additions for
MPW-PPC. I compiled Lout and Lua by myself. The TeX system was put together
from a Lehmanns TeX-CD, which mirrored the Dante TeX-server contents.
The additions to MPW are packet together in an extra archive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additional I included here two versions of the former Thetis C-Interpreter
from Stanford University. It's no longer supported, but it works quite
well on 68k or PPC Macs. This interpreter is not so fast as EiC, but it's
also a complete and mostly unknown C-Interpreter for Macs. This was my
starting point into this subject - I received it from a University friend
overseas. This interpreter was formerly used by the Stanford CS-students
to learn C-programming. It was maintained by the well known professor
Eric S. Roberts, who wrote the very good book "The Art and Science of C",
Addison Wesley (1995). It includes his special addition to the ANSI-C
headers for a more easy introduction to the C language. Thetis-C can also
produce graphics and uses Apples routines internally. It is possible to
make own libraries which then can be loaded with program. The interface is
very similar to Think-C on the Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here you'll also find a free-standing graphic library for MPW, which is
realized as a single header file. Look at the many examples to see if it's
useful for you. The functionality is the same as the EiC graphics library.
    </p>
    <p>
     For friends of simple tools I included an archive with Herbert Schildt's
Little-C Interpreter. Of course, my version is corrected and much more
enhanced. Look what it can do, I think quite a lot for such a little peace
of code. Like EiC for Mac, it's a standard MPW-tool.
    </p>

     For all friends of TeX, here are some puplicy unknown TeX drawing tools,
which I created for my own needs over the past years and which I now give
away freely. Until now I didn't contact the official Dante TeX distribuition
servers fore my special TeX styles, but I will do that, when I got all the
documentations and install files ready. The styles come with many examples,
so you can see how they work. There is Laplot for drawing math functions
with text and formula integration. Then you'll find Ladraw, a complete
drawing environment, which can draw polynomial and even rational (conics
and more) Bezier curves up to a degree of seven - all implemented in pure
TeX macro code. The next one is LaPost for direct integration of Postscipt
into TeX documents and the same for PDF, which is called LaPDF. All
these drawing styles for TeX use their own environment like the Picture
environment of TeX does.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what you get is the ability to draw many kinds of curves (Ladraw also
knows simple looping constructs, whis is used in many examples. You can
plot functions in high quality on any kind of printer and use PostScript's
or PDF's native graphics commands for drawing, which can be used directly
in your TeX document without ever leaving the TeX editor.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the Lout package inside my special MPW version there is the original
Lout documentation in source form, which can be compiled into Postscript from
the MPW shell. Lout is another language for typesetting documents like TeX.
It uses a procedural approach for it's macros, which can be understood easily
by anyone who ever programmend in Pascal or C. Lout does not need special
fonts other than the standard Postscript TypeI fonts. This makes the
compiled Lout document very small, compared to TeX. It's output is PostScript.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lua is a well known scripting languge, which can also be embedded into other
programs. It has much in common with C, but also from functional languages.
The MPW version works wonderful and I had no problems to compile it on the
Mac. The MPW shell is ideal to work with these kind of tools, because you
can use scripts and you have the worksheet window for output with redirection
possibilities.
    </p>

     For the curious: I also compiled EiC for MacMint on PowerPC. Allthough we are
told that MacMint does not understand Graphics, it was no problem to
circumvent this restriction. Just don't tell MacMint, that it deals with
graphic and it will do graphics! Sounds a little bit crazy, but it works. I
compiled the Atari code, but this time used Apples global pointer to the
screen, the mouse and the keyboard. It works great and it uses Apples Bitmap
font, like the Atari version does. By the way, the drawing is directly into
MacMints shell window, which is restored afterwords. Mint can do graphics,
but it does not know this. The compiler used for this, was GCC 2.5.8.

     Here is also an EiC version for Atari. It works on all Atari-ST's and on
MagiCMac. The archive contains everything including the MagicCMac Demo
version. You click on MagicMac and go directly into a shell. There you
type 'e' and now you are in the demo files directory of EiC. Type 'c colors'
without extension and the batch file calls EiC for Atari and run colors.c.
To quit from MagiCMac, simply type 'q' end hit return. To quit EiC programs,
you have to hit 'esc' and return. The graphic library is roughly the same
as the Windows version and also uses Apples bitmap fonts.

     This is the complete GCC package (DJGPP 2.01) for compiling EiC or LCC. As a
separate archive you can also download the WEB2C-TeX distribution with Latex and
PDFTeX. GCC is used to compile the EiC interpreter and the graphics library.
WEB2C TeX is used to typeset the documentation. So you now have all tools at your
fingertips for a powerfull compiler/interpreter duo.

     At this point I would like to make some notes about Delorie's DJGPP. For me,
GCC from this package is the mother of all 32 bit compilers under DOS. It is
just amazing, what you can do with GCC. Of course, it's not the fastest
compiler, but everything it compiles, is solid rock. Delorie made a fantastic
work by developing this complete programming environment for 32 bit DOS. If
you look at all the DJGPP websites around the world, you can guess the importance
of this software product fore the free programmers community. Thank you Delorie at
this place for DJGPP!

     The next file is Ghostscript 7.05 for DOS. This version is very stable,
with high resolution VESA support, and together with the GCC TeX distribution
above you have a complete TeX installment for documentation, which allows you
to produce DVI, PostScript or PDF output. GS.EXE uses the DOS4GW extender.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've tested many of the newer Ghostscript version for DOS, but some where not
working at all, others did some of the examples others failed. These newer versions
usually use long files names, which is not normally supported by DOS and
they are simply one to one compilations of Windows sources with some small
driver hackes for DOS, but they are not developed with great care and much
testing. This 7.05 version of Ghostscript is absolutely stable (I loaded
10 MB documents without any problems), so it's the last classic DOS version I
know of.
    </p>
    <p>
     This year a PDF viewer, called muPDF for DOS was made available to the public.
You find a link to the project site here and also a link to the DOS version of
muPDF. The program only needs a single configuration file, everything else is
contained in the program file. So, it does not depend on any other files.
This program works very well, it shows the text with high accuracy. The only
glitch is that it swaps red and blue colors, this will shurely be fixed soon.
Now you have a full working PDF viewer for PDF files up to PDF version 1.6. If
you have an 1.7 file, you should try to change the version number to 1.6 at the
beginning of the PDF file. I've done this for a long time with my hex editor and
works for most of the files without problems.

     For convenience I added some useful additions to the DOS system, which I
placed into a BIN directory. Here you'll find - beside many tools - a very
easy to use and also a powerful management for all your development tools
under DOS. Look at the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS and also the central batch
file E.BAT (there are some more for Ghostscript and TeX).
Many DOS users have many special batch files to switch from one environment
to another. Here you find a general solution for them all.

     The End

    <p>
     I hope these programming tools and other utilities are helpful and useful for
your own work and I appreciate any (positive or negative) user response. The
only restriction I make here is, that it should help to make EiC even better.
