               ​Fruit of knowledge and experience, we have merged our two great values ​​into a
               <a href="https://thehomeadvise.com/9-best-cast-iron-skillets-set/" target="_blank">
                new cast iron aluminum pan
               </a>
               designed and optimized to offer the best value for money. The new Mint pans.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The Mint collection incorporates a new non-removable handle marked by its pure lines in one of the main trend colors of the moment that will undoubtedly provide that touch of freshness that is so popular in the kitchen. The Mint range of frying pans has a "Full Induction" induction base to ensure the best performance, as well as a high-quality multi-layer non-stick coating. In addition to the cast aluminum body for great heat distribution, it has a high-quality non-stick coating free of PFOA and PTFE and is compatible with all heat sources including induction.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               You can cook with very little oil or even without adding a drop. At Castey we use a reinforced non-stick coating of the highest quality because we know that the most outstanding virtue of a frying pan is that nothing sticks to it.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               And since all the details count, we have given it a very attractive and durable finish. Its exterior has a metallic coating of great hardness. And its interior has a diamond finish that you will love.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Their high performance makes them heat up very quickly in order to save time and energy every time you use them. Food will cook evenly both in the center of the pan and on the sides. And since all the details count, we have given a different finish to the rest of our pans. Its cooking body is a little higher to prevent accidental splashes and help you keep your kitchen hob clean.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               As of today, you will be able to find this new collection at the usual points of sale. They are available in 20, 24, and 28cm.

                Cast iron pans are unrivaled in cooking quality and are potentially eternal, used a lot in the past and making a comeback in today's kitchens.
                <br>
                 <strong>
                  Cast iron is a material
                 </strong>
                 composed of iron-carbon, perfect both for cooking meat and for vegetables and stews because it has the characteristic of perfectly radiating heat and distributing it evenly to food.

                  are pre-seasoned, so all that is required is good maintenance. I often cook in a cast iron pan, I like to cook meat and vegetables, and the cast iron grill pan is exceptional for grilling and obtaining the characteristic lines.

                 Why choose cast iron for cooking food? Because it is a practically indestructible and multipurpose material that makes food better without releasing toxic substances.

                   <br>
                    Cast iron pans can be used on the gas stove and in the oven.
                    <br>
                     Cast iron retains heat well and distributes it evenly, meaning there are no hot or cold spots in the pan. It is very durable and can last forever if we take care of it properly.
                     <br>
                      You can use it to cook meat, sauteed vegetables, eggs, and bacon, bake Dutch pancakes, and many other dishes, avoiding acidic foods such as tomatoes and lemons as they can remove the protective layer created during the curing process.
                      <br>
                       A well-seasoned cast iron skillet has a naturally nonstick surface. With each use, the performance will improve more and more. Regular use and proper cleaning of the cast iron pan improves the "seasoning" of the pan (this is a pre-treatment consisting of a thin layer of fat that seals the iron) which makes it non-stick.

                                             Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to use a small amount of detergent to clean cast iron pans, preferably a delicate and ecological one without perfumes. However large amounts of detergent can wash the treatment off the pan, but you can easily recondition the pan as needed. I prefer not to use detergent for cleaning cast iron.

                                              Don't worry if, by chance, you have removed some of the "seasoning" from the pan, because it is possible to "recondition" the pan after cleaning. It's not a big deal and it's not difficult, here's the procedure.

                     resistant plastic scraper
                    </strong>

                     are the key to comfortable cleaning in the correct way. If your pan has food traces that are difficult to remove, there are no better tools because they are designed specifically for cast iron.

               Although vacuum cleaners are characterized by a
               <strong>
                long service life of eight years and more
               </strong>
               , now and then a new model is simply needed. After all, technology is also making constant progress in the field of vacuum cleaners, so it is worth buying a new device with which you can clean even more effectively and thoroughly. But what should you look out for when buying a vacuum cleaner? Our guide will show you how to find the

               cleaner for your needs.​
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Check vacuum cleaner recommendations and your own needs. In general, the
               <strong>
                recommendation is to do some research before you buy
               </strong>
               . After all, there are a large number of designs from different manufacturers available on the market. It is always useful to take a look at the vacuum cleaner test or test report summaries, but in any case, you should also think about your own needs and local circumstances.
               <ul style="color:rgb(14, 16, 26)">

                <li>
                 <span>
                  Should it be a vacuum cleaner with or without a bag?
                 </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <span>
                  Are there pets in the household?

                <li>

                </li>

                in advance.

               is the be-all and end-all with a modern, new vacuum cleaner. After all, what use is the best suction power if vacuuming becomes torture? Therefore, a healthy, back-friendly way of working must be given and an

               , with which you can best make all important settings, is a must. The length of the telescopic tube must be adjustable and thus perfectly adaptable to your height.

               But
               <strong>
                smooth-running and gentle rollers
               </strong>
               as well as the largest possible radius of action - guaranteed by a long cable length and suction hose - are important criteria so that you don't have to constantly change the socket. Of course, the vacuum cleaner must not be too heavy and bulky, so that the device can be carried and easily stowed away if necessary. We recommend that you try the vacuum cleaner directly in the shop so that you can get a better feel for the operation. If you want to buy a vacuum cleaner at a lower price on the Internet, you should also take a look at the customer reviews.

               that doesn't take up much space is sufficient. For a detached house with different floor coverings, on the other hand, a classic canister vacuum cleaner with a sled is the better decision. These vacuum cleaners are suitable for vacuuming carpets, tiles, or parquet floors, and it is particularly practical if the suction power or wattage can be regulated so that furniture and curtains can also be vacuumed. Whether you are after the vacuum cleaner purchase advice for a model Deciding with or without a bag is a matter of taste, especially since the devices hardly differ, at least in terms of suction power, thanks to the latest technologies.
               <br/>
               More watts doesn't mean more power. But don't let yourself be blinded by a high wattage when buying.
               <strong>
                The wattage is often wrongly equated with the suction power
               </strong>
               , according to the motto: the higher the wattage, the better the suction power! But this is not the case. Because the new vacuum cleaners guarantee consistently high suction power even with a low wattage of fewer than 1,400 watts and thus ensure lower energy consumption, as repeatedly in the vacuum cleaner testis proven. This protects both the wallet and the environment.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Pay attention to the filter performance and volume. You should also attach particular importance to the
               <strong>
                filter performance.
               </strong>
               Vacuumed dust, which is released back into the living room through the exhaust air, not only affects allergy sufferers but also puts a

                strain on the respiratory tract
               </strong>
               in general. The housing of the vacuum cleaner must therefore be absolutely tight and ideally designed in such a way that noise is absorbed. This keeps the dust and dirt inside the device and you can look forward to quiet operating noise. If you want to vacuum
               <strong>
                flexible in terms of time
               </strong>
               - i.e. sometimes late at night - then low-noise and quiet vacuum cleaners with less than 70 dB are just right, the operating noise of which corresponds approximately to the volume of a conversation.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               What can a good vacuum cleaner cost? The
               <strong>
                price range of vacuum cleaners is just as wide as the selection of different types and manufacturers
               </strong>
               . Although there are good models for less than 100 euros to buy, if you invest a little more money, you will also get a better vacuum cleaner. Review summaries can provide very helpful information here. In general, it is advisable to choose a well-known brand manufacturer such as Miele vacuum cleaners, Siemens, AEG, Dyson, etc., even if there are cheaper, cheap products from no-name manufacturers.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               But on the one hand, the
               <strong>
                quality, processing, and suction power are simply better and on the other hand, you will probably not find
               </strong>
               accessories such as vacuum cleaner bags, vacuum cleaner nozzles, or vacuum cleaner brushes so easily for no-name products. In addition, you do not buy a vacuum cleaner every day, but rather the device should provide reliable service for many years. Therefore, when purchasing, the price should not be the priority.
               <br/>
               If the budget is limited, there are always special offers to buy or you fall back on a

                model from the previous series
               </strong>
               . It should also be borne in mind that bugless vacuum cleaners are more expensive to buy, but are cheaper to maintain because the vacuum cleaner bags are not available and required. In addition, you should always compare the prices in stores with those on the Internet. Buying
               <strong>
                online is usually cheaper

                Vacuum cleaning is one of the most important and unpleasant cleaning tasks on your own four walls. The following tips reveal how often you should vacuum, what you should consider when vacuuming properly so that it is

               <br/>
               Certainly very few people think about it and just start vacuuming. But this is a big mistake because, without proper preparation, vacuuming takes far too long and is even less fun. If you have to vacuum around countless objects, you unnecessarily lose a lot of time and quickly lose interest.
               <br/>
               In the worst case, you might knock over a vase or plant while vacuuming and create a lot of dirt, or you might suck up a larger object and damage the

               . To be able to vacuum as effectively and safely as possible, you should make the following preparations:

               </strong>
               <br/>
               Some people love vacuuming or see it as a useful workout and people who find vacuuming extremely annoying or even really hate it. Regardless of which group of people you belong to, there is no way around regular vacuuming in your own home. Unless you hire a cleaning lady, but this costs a lot of money!
               <br/>
               To ensure that the floors remain reliably clean, you should pick up the vacuum cleaner and clean the apartment at least every 2 to 3 days. The
               <strong>
                frequency
               </strong>
               mainly depends on the room or the use of the room. In the kitchen or the living room, there is significantly more dirt than in other rooms. Depending on the intensity of use, you should vacuum every 3 days at the latest.
               <br/>
               Hair and other particles land on the
               <strong>
                bathroom floor
               </strong>
               every day and these should be removed every 2 to 3 days. House corridor, hallway, and bedroom are used comparatively less and therefore do not have to be vacuumed every second or third day. Upholstered furniture, such as armchairs or couches, can be vacuumed thoroughly once every 2 weeks. If there are pets in the household that lose a lot of hair or feathers, the corresponding rooms usually have to be vacuumed daily.

                In general, you should only start vacuuming as soon as the respective room is free.

                If you want to vacuum properly, it also depends on the technology.

               <span>
                It is best to start in the corner furthest from the room door and work your way forward.

                , otherwise, it cannot suck up all the crumbs, hair, and dust grains. It is best

               <br/>
               <span>
                In the corners, you should always remove the vacuum cleaner attachment and only vacuum with the vacuum cleaner tube. If you vacuum tiles or laminate, you should always use a brush attachment, otherwise, these areas can be

                How To Make Pans Not Stick?

               <font color="#2a2a2a">
                Well, these are the tips that work for both nonstick pans and nonstick pans without coating. These recommendations will make your pan non-stick or less sticky:

               <ul>

                   ONLY IN PANS WITH NON-STICK COATING:
                  </span>
                  The hotter they are, the more likely they are to stick, therefore we will try to heat only as much as necessary, trying to avoid unnecessary "peaks", which on the other hand could also spoil the non-stick coating, which usually resists 240ºC at most. .

                  </span>
                  you have to do as it was always done, before non-stick pans were invented, that is, use more oil, butter...etc., depending on the model and non-stick capacity of the pan, you have to find out How much oil do you normally need? Of course, on pans without a nonstick coating, you'll usually need more.

                  Above all, do not put food in the pan until the pan is hot, that is, until the pan is hot, do not add food. Never put food cold and heat from scratch.

                  and remove it. Then put it back for another 3 seconds and finally put the food in the pan to cook it. In this way, especially with the meat, it acclimatizes to the pan and reduces the possibility of sticking.

                  For example, in pans that are entirely made of stainless steel or any other that does not have a non-stick coating on the cooking surface, the pan must be very hot beforehand so that it does not stick. Over time, if you have experience, you will know when it is at the exact point, but if at first you do not know, you can do the "water test":
                  <br/>
                  When the pan is very hot and WITHOUT oil or fat, completely empty, add half a teaspoon of water and watch. If the water stays like a ball of mercury, as well as floating that moves without a trail or trace (an effect similar to when you pour water into a non-stick pan), then that is the point.

               Drink water every day, but have you ever paid attention to water bottles for drinking water? Bacteria and carcinogens hidden in a water bottle can easily steal your health if the cup is not chosen correctly. So
               <strong>
                which water bottle is safe to use
               </strong>
               ? What kind of water bottle is potentially dangerous?
               <br/>
               <strong>
                Glass Bottle For Water
               </strong>
               <br/>
               1. The
               <strong>
                material
               </strong>
               is the safest. Based on the material of the water cup, the glass
               <strong>
                water bottle
               </strong>
               is the safest to drink. The glass is made from inorganic silicates and does not contain organic chemicals. And the cup body is smooth, easy to clean, not easily propagated by bacteria.
               <br/>
               2. Explosion hazard. The glass material has strong thermal conductivity. If the water temperature is too high and the
               <a href="https://loveyourself-n-blog.tumblr.com/post/652082876809150464/sports-water-bottle-buying-tips" target="_blank">
                plastic water bottle
               </a>
               breaks easily, hot water should be avoided. In addition, the glass water bottle is washed out for a long time with water. The reaction between sodium silicate and carbon dioxide in the air will lead to the formation of white carbonate crystals, and prolonged replacement of the glass water bottle will damage your health.

               <strong>
                Buying Guide:
               </strong>
               <br/>
               1. When choosing a glass water bottle, we should pay attention to the presence of cracks in the inner and outer layers of the glass water bottle. Cracked glass water bottle is easy to burst after hot water pumping.
               <br/>
               2. Check if the body of the glass water bottle is ok, it is not recommended to choose a glass bottle with impurities or bubbles.
               <br/>
               3. High borosilicate glass is preferred in material. This kind of
               <strong>
                glass water bottle
               </strong>
               is more heat-resistant, wear-resistant and drop-resistant than ordinary glass water bottle. Generally, it will not break due to a sudden change in temperature difference.
               <br/>
               Directions for use: It is recommended that the use time of the glass does not exceed one year. White crystals can be washed with alkaline detergent or disinfected with boiled hot water for 10 minutes every week.
               <br/>
               <strong>
                Plastic Bottle For Water
               </strong>
               <br/>
               1. Carcinogenic risk. Plastic products such as polyethylene and polypropylene have no toxic components, but when used to hold hot water, toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A, which are linked to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and premature sexual intercourse, can easily enter the water. When ingested, it is difficult to decompose and it can also be inherited.
               <br/>
               2. Production of bacteria. Plastic water bottles are very easily multiplied by
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" target="_blank">
                bacteria
               </a>
               . While the plastic surface looks smooth, there are actually many voids that can easily hide dirt.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <strong>
                Buying Guide:
               </strong>
               For plastic water bottles, it is best to choose PP or Tritan materials. Plus, it's better to buy quality products through regular channels.
