We recommend that you reach out to your customers and ask them to cancel their disputes.</p>\n\n<p>We apologize for the inconveniences this will undoubtedly cause, but, to be sure, it is the best deal we could negotiate to keep creators on our platform and not punish them for the sake of upholding banking policies.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see <a href="%{about_chargebacks_url}">how Gumroad handles chargebacks</a>.</p>\n',user_probation_notification_email_title:"Regarding your Gumroad account",user_sales_data_attachment_text:"We've attached the customer data you requested to this email.",user_sales_data_link_text:"Please click this <a href='%{url}'>link</a> to download the customer data you requested.",user_sales_data_title:"Your requested data",user_suspension_for_fraud_notification_email_text:'Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, due to the strict banking and government regulations we are bound to, and risk concerns surrounding your account\'s behavior, we have been forced to suspend your sales and will not be able to continue working with you.
