      Ensemble is the next generation of the
      <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/HORUS/Overview.html">
       Horus
      </a>
      group communication toolkit. Developed at
      <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/">
       Cornell University
      </a>
      , as well as at 
      the

       Hebrew University of 
      Jerusalem
      </a>
      .
      <h3>
       Language support
      </h3>
      The current distribution provides support for 
      applications developed in ML, C, C++, and Java.
      <ul>
       <li>
        ML: Ensemble is implemented in the
        <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/ocaml">
         Objective Caml
        </a>
        programming 
        language (a dialect of ML). The use of ML supports a variety of 
        optimizations that enable Ensemble to achieve communication latencies an 
        order of magnitude faster than Horus (some of these optimizations are 
        still under research)
        <li>
         Native C interface. Since version 1.31, the system includes a
         <i>
          native
         </i>
         C interface whereby an application can send
	    io-vectors directly to the network. Received message are
	    copied directly into user buffers. This facilitates a C
	    interface that has the same performance as the ML interface
         <li>
          C++:
          <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble/doc/maestro/Maestro.htm">
           Maestro 
	    Group Tools
          </a>
          provide an object-oriented interface to Ensemble.
          <li>
           Native Java interface. Since version 1.38, the
	    system includes
           native
           Java interface. This allows
	    Java applications to tap the power of Ensemble without
	    having to step out of the Java virtual
	    machine. Preliminary performance assessments show good
	    latency and throughput.

      <h3>
       Building applications with Ensemble
      </h3>
      For an application builder, 
      Ensemble provides a library of protocols that can be used for quickly 
      building complex distributed applications. An application registers 10 or 
      so event handlers with Ensemble, and then the Ensemble protocols handle 
      the details of reliably sending and receiving messages, transferring 
      state, implementing security, detecting failures, and managing 
      reconfigurations in the system.
      <h3>
       A research tool
      </h3>
      For a distributed systems researcher, Ensemble is 
      a highly modular and reconfigurable toolkit. The high-level protocols 
      provided to applications are really stacks of tiny protocol "layers." 
      These protocol layers each implement several simple properties: they are 
      composed to provide sets of high-level properties, such as total ordering, 
      security, virtual synchrony, etc.... Individual layers can be modified or 
      rebuilt to experiment with new properties or change the performance 
      characteristics of the system. This makes Ensemble a very flexible 
      platform on which to do research.
