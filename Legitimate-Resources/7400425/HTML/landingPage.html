      <strong>
       Macdonald Oil and Gas
      </strong>
      is a family operated mineral and royalty management business comprised of multiple entities with oil and gas interest ownership throughout the United States.  The largest portions of these interests are located in Oklahoma and Texas.  Other interests are located in New Mexico, Louisiana, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and California. Our start came mostly from mineral and royalty interests passed down through generations of family with royalities from production historically referred to as “mailbox money”.  What was a small start has grown into a much larger endeavor through years of acquisition and de-fractionalization.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our main goal is to acquire, lease and receive income from both leasing activity and oil and gas royalty revenue.  Our values are based on working together with the companies that drill and produce as we mutually benefit from the same end result, bringing US natural resources to the consumer.
