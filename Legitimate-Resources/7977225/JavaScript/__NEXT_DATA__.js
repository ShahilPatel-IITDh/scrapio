Optimise's campaign specialists worked with the client's in-house team to simplify the migration process and to ensure it was completed successfully without interrupting campaigns or impacting sales.\n\nAs part of this process, Optimise implemented Server-to-Server (S2S) tracking, its future-proofed tracking technology, to help the client confidently track conversions and ensure the accuracy of its data. This innovative technology uses cookieless tracking to mitigate data privacy concerns and the impacts of tracking protection.\n\nWith S2S tracking, the bank could easily view the complete customer journey by tracking critical events in real time. As a result, the bank could now improve its understanding of customer behaviour and fine-tune its campaigns and commissions, to achieve even better results.\n"},"success3":{"title":"Growth target exceeded and more sales tracked","description":"The client excelled with its partnership marketing, achieving a 70% increase in partner traffic, a more than threefold improvement on its target of 20%.

Affiliates had been one of the most profitable channels for Go.Compare, so the comparison website wanted to continue maximising its results without compromising quality.\n\nOptimise began by completing a deep dive into the historical activity using Go.Compare data and insights from its innovative Partner Intelligence tool. This detailed analysis directly informed the campaign targets: to grow traffic share by 15%, grow sales by 10% and diversify Go.Compare’s affiliate and partner base to broaden the source of traffic and sales. \n"},"success2":{"title":"Creating new opportunities through customer incentives","description":"As part of the strategy to meet the campaign goals, Optimise identified an opportunity to explore unique customer incentives as a new tactic. As a result, Optimise recommended the use of Rewards for rapidly creating and deploying user incentive campaigns. \n\nOptimise Rewards is the in-house digital voucher fulfilment platform which handles every step of the incentive journey from the first click to issuing the incentive to the customer. The clever alignment of both validation files and reward fulfilments made the whole process seamless for the consumer, partner and Go.Compare. \n\nWith this new capability, Go.Compare could also create unique and bespoke incentives for each partner to help them establish brand-new partnerships in the incentive space.\n\n"},"success3":{"title":"Securing strategic partnerships","description":"Optimise also secured further new partnerships to drive Go.Compare's growth plans: \n\n- Closed User Group Partners - leveraging partners like Very-me Rewards, Vodafone's loyalty programme for pay monthly and PAYG customers, which doubled their performance on average due to the new and refreshed incentive offer.\n\n- Tech Partners - Gener8, which allows users to earn points from their tracked online data, added Go.Compare to its browser extension that promotes rewards and offers.\n\n- OEMs - Original Equipment Manufacturers such as VeVe, which promotes brands via pre-installed apps on new handsets and devices.\n\nIn addition, due to the ambitious nature of Go.Compare's objectives, the Optimise team explored untapped opportunities within the comparison website's wide range of products. Optimise assessed the commercial viability of each product set and identified travel insurance and car leasing products to add to the affiliate channel.\n"},"success4":{"title":"Deploying innovative technology to deliver unique market insights","description":"Achieving Go.Compare's bold goals meant the comparison website's existing partnerships had to be optimised. Optimise capitalised on its unique Partner Intelligence technology to track and monitor Go.Compare's position and performance in the cashback market against its competitors for both popularity listings and tenancy placements.\n\nUsing Partner Intelligence, Optimise identified specific tactics that would enable Go.Compare to keep its popularity rankings and drive up volumes without increasing the overall CPA. Partner Intelligence pinpointed the optimum time to run the promotions, such as payday weeks, to maximise effectiveness and allow Go.Compare to successfully outmanoeuvre its competitors.
