         <br/>
         Cast iron is one of the most popular materials in the kitchen because it is versatile, solid, and long-lasting. Let's find out how to choose a cast iron pot!
         <br/>
         From the polenta pot to the casserole up to the wok pan: cast iron has proven to be an infallible ally in the kitchen.
         <br/>
         <img alt="pentola-in-ghisa.jpg" class="image" src="https://www.cucinarefacile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pentola-in-ghisa.jpg"/>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Why exactly cast iron?
          </strong>
          <br/>
          It heats up slower than others and therefore retains heat longer. It also manages to withstand even high temperatures and can be used both in the oven and on the stove.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           What are cast iron pans used for?
          </strong>
          <br/>
          In practice, a cast iron pot allows you to prepare delicious recipes both when it comes to simpler dishes and when you intend to replicate the recipes of professional chefs.
          <br/>
          The success of this material is proven by the wide range of

           cast iron cookware on the market

          . Unfortunately, this could make the choice more complicated.

          <span>
           What makes cast iron special?
          </span>
         </h1>
         Cast iron is a material that has always been used in the kitchen and has returned to the spotlight thanks to the recovery of culinary traditions.
         <br/>
         In particular, being a ferrous alloy composed of iron and carbon, it has a lower thermal conductivity than that of aluminum and steel and therefore distributes the heat received evenly.
         <br/>
         Furthermore, the fact that it is an excellent insulator allows cast iron to maintain a constant internal temperature even when it is no longer exposed to the heat source. The same goes for the cold too.

           How to choose the best-cast iron pot
          </span>
         </h1>
         It's quick to say "I'm buying a cast iron pot " if you don't know how to choose the best product based on your needs.
         <br/>
         The only way to orient yourself among the many cast iron pans is to evaluate the characteristics and compare the various proposals about personal needs. Here's where to start:
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Dimensions
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The dimensions are important not only because they influence the capacity (which we will see below), the weight, and the space occupied in the kitchen. For this reason, it is good to evaluate the diameter of each pot.
         <br/>
         Usually, it ranges from 15 to 41 centimeters, but those who don't want to choose between a larger or smaller pot can opt for the purchase of a multi-piece set.
         <br/>
         It is always good to keep in mind that the bigger the cast iron pan, the heavier it will be to handle and the more cumbersome it will be in the kitchen.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Capacity
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The model's capacity determines the amount of food you can prepare and the number of guests you can serve.
         <br/>
         In this case, it is enough to wink at the capacity expressed in liters reported by the manufacturer to get an idea of ââthe maximum capacity of each model.
         <br/>
         For example, a 2-liter capacity model is perfect for 2 people, a 6-liter cast iron pan allows you to prepare food for 4-6 people while an 8-liter model is ideal for at least 8-10 people.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Form
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Not all cast iron pans are the same and the shape is one of the characterizing elements that are worth evaluating. Why? Among other things, it greatly influences what to
         <strong>
          cook in a cast iron pot.
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Most of the models have a circular base and high, thick edges, but there are also oval pots and lower edges.
         <br/>
         There is no a priori right or wrong choice because a lot depends on the type of dish: round and with high edges if you prepare something to be stirred continuously such as a stew or risotto and oval and with low edges if you have to cook a soup slowly or a braised meat.
         <br/>
         For completeness, as we have already dealt with previously, let's say that there are also cast iron pans of different formats: cast iron pans for bread, oven dishes, pans with handles, works, and so on.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Coating
         </strong>
         <br/>
         What makes the difference between the various cast iron pans on the market is the internal coating: natural or enameled?
         <br/>
         Natural â Models with a natural cast iron coating are more heat resistant and durable than enameled ones. Therefore they are also suitable for cooking on coals. Unfortunately, they require more careful cleaning.
         <br/>
         Enameled â The enameled cast iron pot has a black or white layer capable of offering a non-stick effect and facilitating cleaning. However, it can easily get scratched or damaged.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Cover
         </strong>
         <br/>
         It is not so obvious that the cast iron pot lid is also made of cast iron: this is the case for most models, but it is not always true.
         <br/>
         Many cast iron pans are equipped with a cast iron lid, but some models have a glass lid intended to facilitate the control of food cooking.
         <br/>
         Those who prefer the second option ( cast iron pot and glass lid) should pay attention to the cooking temperature because tempered glass is resistant but not as strong as cast iron.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Cleaning
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The advice on how to clean the cast iron pan is necessary to ensure a long-lasting pan but varies according to the type of coating.
         <br/>
         Enameled cast iron pans are easy to clean (preferably by hand) by removing external food residues with a cloth soaked in water and using neutral soap and non-abrasive sponges for the inside.
         <br/>
         On the contrary, although they are more resistant, the natural cast iron models must undergo periodic seasoning (applying a layer of fat and heating in the oven for a few hours) and careful cleaning.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Prezzo
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The price of a cast iron pan varies according to the characteristics and the brand, ranging from just under 40 euros to over 200 euros.

          </a>
          : according to the size of the kitchen table to decide
          <br/>
          Choose a single slot accounted for the smaller size, saving the kitchen space if the kitchen table size is small, can not let go of the double slot, the choice of the large single slot. If the kitchen table size, then, whether it is a double slot or a single slot, will not have any impact, the choice of the double slot, size specifications are much larger than the single slot, but it is also very convenient to use.
         </p>
         <p>
          2, the kitchen sink single slot or double slot good: according to the use of habits to decide
          <br/>
          If you like to put the big pots are put into the sink inside the cleaning, but the cabinet is small, the location of the sink is not much, you can directly use a larger single sink; if you are accustomed to using a sink to clean vegetables or bowl, On the choice of double-slot, use a single slot, then a waste of water, not environmentally friendly. The biggest difference between the two is that half of the tank can be used to clean the greasy things, generally used to clean vegetables, but the sink area is relatively small; the single slot is the large area, will not easily spread to the table on the water.

          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Single slot cheap, the same installation space, the single slot can get more use of space. That is, on the table to open the same large hole, a single tank of the use of space than the double slot. Another single slot is only one water, the sewer is easier than the double slot.
          <br/>
          Double slot, although expensive, but the same installation space can be more convenient to use, a sink can be used to brush pot, wash cloth and so dirty, the other for washing dishes, vegetables, wash fruit. Picking things in one, the other for draining and so on. But the double slot has two water, the water management is more complex, the probability of bad is also high. If your home sink position, put a double slot can also choose one of the large pots can easily put down the large cleaning.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is not convenient to place the items after cleaning a single tank (so the single tank also produces a lot of types, such as an increase in the drain area). The benefits of the double slot are different food or tableware can be placed separately, the functional partition is more reasonable, it is recommended that if the cabinet can be placed double slot, or choose a double slot is more appropriate, even if the best single slot also drain.

           Is the nonstick coating toxic?

         </h1>
         <p>
          The emergence of non-stick pans has provided great convenience to our kitchen life-not only do you need to worry about sticking to the bottom of the pan, cooking is less oily, and it is also very convenient to clean! Now many families have a non-stick pan at home, whether it is a wok or a frying pan.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, as the non-stick pan comes into life, peopleâs doubts about the safety of the coating have never ceased:
          <br/>
          *Is the nonstick coating toxic?
          <br/>

           Can it be used if the coating is off?
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Is it safe to cook things in a non-stick panâ¦
          <br/>
          In this article, Shi Jun and everyone will find out.
          <br/>
          First of all, we divide non-stick pans into categories, which are two types:
          <br/>
          Black (fluorine-containing coating) and non-black (ceramic coating).
          <br/>
          The picture comes from the Internet, here is only used for information dissemination, intrusion, and deletion
         </p>
         <p>
          Ceramic coating is safer and more beautiful. However, more than 90% of households use a black fluorine-containing coating. Why?
          <br/>
          Because the ceramic coating is expensive! And the "non-stick properties" are not ideal. In contrast, fluorine-containing coatings are more cost-effective, and more people choose. So this article focuses on non-stick pans with fluorine coating.
          <br/>
          <strong>
           Is the nonstick coating toxic?
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          There are two reasons why people have such safety questions.
          <br/>
          The first reason is that a processing aid called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was used in the production of non-stick pans. There are reports that this substance can cause cancer and is related to birth defects, so people are worried.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are still some controversies about the impact of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on human health, but no matter what the controversy is, everyone does not have to worry, because perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is no longer used in the production of non-stick pan coatings.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the end of 2011, all non-stick cookware had achieved PFOA removal. As long as the Teflon-coated cookware launched in 2012 and later, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) will no longer be used.
          <br/>
          The second reason is that most non-stick pans are coated with Teflon-polytetrafluoroethylene. This substance has very stable physical and chemical properties at room temperature and normal conditions, but under certain conditions, it will release harmful substances. However, as long as the content of the following point 2 is achieved, there is no need to worry about normal use.
         </p>

           Precautions for using a non-stick pan
          </span>
         </h1>
         <strong>
          Throw away the sticky non-stick frying pan
         </strong>
         <br/>
         If you find that the coating of the
         <a href="http://https://thehomeadvise.com/best-non-stick-frying-pan/">
          non-stick frying pan
         </a>
         is peeling off, do not continue to use it. After all, the peeling coating is falling into the food. No one will recommend you to eat the coatingâ¦
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Be careful not to exceed 260Â°C, and do not dry it on an open flame
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The main component, PTFE, begins to deteriorate at a temperature above 260Â°C and begins to decompose to produce harmful substances above 380Â°C. There is no need to worry about cooking, because the highest temperature of frying is only about 180â~240â, and the non-stick pan is still very stable.
         <br/>
         <img alt="81zaz7By2rL._AC_SL1500_-300x251.jpg" class="image" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thehomeadvise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/81zaz7By2rL._AC_SL1500_-300x251.jpg"/>
         However, dry burning with an open flame will reach this temperature, causing the non-stick pan to decompose harmful substances, so dry burning with an open flame must be prohibited!
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Take care of the coating and avoid bumps. This includes:
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Don't use a shovel for cooking! Do not use sharp metal tools, wooden spatula, or silicone spatula.
         <br/>
         Don't fry crab and shrimp clams! Try to avoid cooking hard food.
         <br/>
         Do not rub and wash hard, and do not use steel wool.
         <br/>
         Don't put utensils in it when you pack the dishes.
         <br/>
         All in all, don't do anything that can bump into the coating! Be gentle and take care of your children.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Donât wash with cold water immediately after cooking
         </strong>
         <br/>
         This will cause thermal expansion and contraction to cause the coating to fall off, so you should wait for the temperature to drop before cleaning.
         <br/>
         <img alt="81eYDdQJECL._AC_SL1500_-300x214.jpg" class="image" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thehomeadvise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/81eYDdQJECL._AC_SL1500_-300x214.jpg"/>
         In the final analysis, there are two aspects: one is to prevent the decomposition of harmful substances and control the use temperature &lt;260â; the other is to prevent the coating from falling off: don't bump it with hard objects.
         <br/>
         Remember?
         <br/>
         <strong>
          How to choose?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         <strong>
          What kind of coating is good?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Frequent cooking: decisively choose fluorine-containing coating! The fluorine-containing coating is cost-effective. Among the well-known coating, brands are DuPont's Teflon coating and Huafu coating.
         <br/>
         Cook less and pursue beauty: throw into the arms of ceramic non-stick pans! After all, you can get countless praises from the circle of friends when you put it on the table, which can highlight the beauty and quality of your life.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Choose a big brand + product with a good appearance
         </strong>
         <br/>
         If you can't see the real thing, it's still the same sentence, try to choose a big brand product is right.
         <br/>
         <img alt="71SoQRsHoAL._AC_SL1500_-300x289.jpg" class="image" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thehomeadvise.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/71SoQRsHoAL._AC_SL1500_-300x289.jpg"/>
         <br/>
         If you can see the real object, you should focus on the surface of the coating: the surface is smooth, there are no obvious defects such as bubbles, dirt, cracks, and explosions, the color is consistent, the coating does not fall off, and the handle of the non-stick pan should be firm and stable.
         <br/>
         <strong>
          Test with eggs after you buy it
         </strong>
         <br/>
         1/ Heat the new non-stick pan to about 140 degrees (you can feel the heat when the palm is about 10Â cm from the bottom of the pan);
         <br/>
         2/ Do not put oil, beat a raw egg and other egg whites are solidified;
         <br/>
         3/ The fried eggs can easily slide in the pan, and there is no egg sticking residue at the bottom of the pan, indicating that the non-stickiness meets the requirements of national standards.

           Have both open and closed storage in the kitchen
          </span>
         </h1>
         There is talk of open and closed storage in the kitchen context now, and there are two clear camps. Those who do not want any cupboards at all but put up shelves and leave plates, glasses, and beautiful bowls on display. And those who think it seems impractical from a primarily cleaning point of view with open storage and therefore run the more traditional solution with
         <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=wall+cabinets&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;go=Go&amp;ns0=1">
          wall cabinets
         </a>
         .
         <br/>
         But there is something in between! To choose closed storage, but to leave a certain port open for the very finest bowls, cookbooks, and objects. A little enough to put up with the extra cleaning, enough to give a slightly more airy impression. Here are three examples!
         <br/>
         <img alt="kok-fantastic-frank2-husligheter-1024x683.jpg" class="image" src="https://www.mariasoxbo.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kok-fantastic-frank2-husligheter-1024x683.jpg"/>
         <p>
          I think this example from Fantastic Frank is inspiring precisely because it looks a bit unplanned. Not perfect symmetry, but the fan has had to be hidden in a closed part and so you have left a little open on one side and more on the other. Nice and airy - think how compact this wall would have looked with only cupboards in comparison.
         </p>
         This kitchen also comes from a Fantastic Frank object, and here the open part has instead ended up at the far end of an edge. This can of course be fixed in an existing kitchen by lifting a door, but then I recommend making sure to fill the holes on the inside if there are adjustable shelves so that it looks built-in rather than a door is missing.

         <br/>
         You probably already have Johanna Bradford's dream kitchen from Nordiska kÃ¶k, and since we all probably associate Johanna with open storage, I'm not surprised by this great solution. Here it is instead completely symmetrical, and a bit reminiscent of old serving corridors with storage space and storage underneath. The cabinets on each side contain white goods, and the sink and stove are against another wall so it was not necessary to take them into account. Amazingly beautiful!

         I who sketch at a slow pace for a new kitchen for us, because we have now spent almost five years in a kitchen that was in poor condition already when we moved in (and which was the only budget renovated by us) should have this âhave the cake and eat it âPossibility in mind, because right now I think we have far tooâ cupboard âkitchen.
