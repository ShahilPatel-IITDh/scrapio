                Heat Resistant - Go ahead, toss in a hot pan. Throw in a baking sheet. Or put that boiling pot right on the work area. Withstanding temperatures of up to 536 Degree, you can't burn, scorch or mar a SILGRANIT II sink. Scratch Resistant - Steak knives. Carving knives, paring knives, pots and pans, you name it, SILGRANIT II can handle it. So whether you're slicing, dicing, mincing or chopping, you just can't scratch this sink. Acid Resistant- Slice a lemon. Squeeze a grapefruit. When it comes to citrus, SILGRANIT II has no fear. Rock hard granite material creates an acid-resistant surface, so you can enjoy all your favorite foods without damaging the finish. Stain Resistant - No matter what you're drinking, pouring. or even sometimes spilling, SILGRAIT II sinks are designed to defy all types of stains. In fact, the ultra-durable, non-porous material resists everything from black tea to red wine.

            <br/>
            Try to choose a color that combines with the rest, that is cheerful and that allows us to return the island as a piece of furniture that integrates with the decoration.

            Most models have cabinets and drawers, although some other models have the advantage of having shelves for the storage space. Some models are car-type, with large wheels, a very favorable point for when you need to clean the kitchen. Although the kitchen has a lot of space, it is not necessary to occupy all the free space with an island, it will only be necessary to gain a space of work and adequate support.

             Errors that should be avoided when choosing an islet
            </span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When you are going to place the islet you must prevent it from interfering with the working triangle formed by the stove, sink and refrigerator. Undoubtedly the triangle of work is a lot of activity and displacement, so you do not have to count on anything that prevents free access.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Choose a model that has an important storage space . Kitchens usually have a lot of things, it is normal that we end up saving more than what is due in the kitchen cabinets preventing us from finding or seeing things with ease.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When you go to organize your kitchen you have to plan and evaluate the available space. In case the kitchen is small you can add an islet with more storage space.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            One of the biggest problems when designing the kitchen is the lack of worktops. When you choose the size of an islet with a countertop you will have to meditate about the activities that you will perform on its surface. Some of them can count on a table that adapts enlarging the work surface.

             The Importance of Lighting

            In order for the island to fulfill its function, it must have, as well as the whole kitchen, a very good illumination . In the case of an island that can be moved from one place to another this point should be carefully evaluated.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The kitchen should have excellent lighting. Not only depends on the design but in this room the decoration is a safety issue. You can count on three different lighting types: general lighting for general lighting, task lighting and spot lighting.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It is very important to have direct lighting on the main work areas, you can use hanging lights or a series of mini hanging lights in areas where lighting can be improved.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The pendant lights look perfectly well above the sinks and the islets. If the kitchen is the environment where, in addition to preparing food, you eat the table you will need to have a very good lighting.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A model for every need
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In this article we have presented different photos in which you can find several models of kitchen islands that you can place in your home without having to perform a work. There are larger models, smaller, with drawers, with wheels, with shelves . Some are cheerful colors while others follow a much more classic style. The important thing is that they fulfill all the functions that the islands must meet.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            An ideal height for your island will be 87/90 centimeters, if in addition to use as storage space you want to have a place for breakfast or lunch should be 105 centimeters (about 15 centimeters higher than normal). If it exceeds this height it will not be so comfortable because it will be difficult to access its central spaces.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Remember to choose a correct location for the island, the important thing is that you can have easy access to the refrigerator, sink and oven.

            On the other hand thinks that if you are going to use this space for breakfast you will need stools and a flown worktop that allows to place the legs without being annoying or uncomfortable.
