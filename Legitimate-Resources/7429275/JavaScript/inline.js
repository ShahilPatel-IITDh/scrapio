Different categories of taxpayers use different templates of this series. The IRS 1040-SR tax form was specially designed for citizens over 65 years of age in 2018. It is similar to the original file and has the same instructions but is optimized specifically for the elderly. It requires almost the same information as for documnet. Additional attention is paid to various senior-specific benefits. Also, for the convenience of adult taxpayers, the text on this document was made in a larger font. Form 1040-SR is an optional variant designed to simplify tax filing for retirees. You can use the original template if you like." } }
