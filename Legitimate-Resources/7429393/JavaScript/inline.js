Additionally, if you sponsor one or more Sponsored Account(s), your and the Sponsored Account’s Cash App Balances are covered by FDIC pass-through insurance, regardless of whether you or the Sponsored Account has been issued a Cash Card.

A Gift Card can only be used with a Cash Card purchase at the designated merchant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Recipient does not have a Cash Card, they may elect to add the cash value of the Gift Card to their Cash App Balance, or they may request a Cash Card as described in Section VIII.1 (Issuance of the Cash Card) below and then accept the Gift Card. If the Recipient does not accept the Gift Card within 30 days of receipt, the cash value of the Gift Card will be added to their Cash App Balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCash App does not guarantee the availability of Gift Cards for any merchant. There are no fees to send or accept a Gift Card, and once a Recipient accepts a Gift Card, it does not expire. The minimum send amount is $1, and the maximum send amount is $2,000 per sender, per day. If a Recipient accepts multiple Gift Cards for the same merchant, they will be combined into a single balance for use with that merchant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eIV.

You must have sufficient Fiat Currency in your Cash App Balance before submitting any “Buy” transaction. A “Buy” transaction is a sale from Block to you. Once complete, your Hosted Balance will reflect the amount of Virtual Currency that you own. All right to and title in the Virtual Currency bought will pass from Block to you.

If you set up a Recurring Buy, you authorize and instruct Block to debit Fiat Currency from your Cash App Balance or Eligible Bank Account (as applicable) in the amount you instruct for each Recurring Buy and on the periodic interval you instruct (e.g. daily, monthly, weekly). Block will execute each Recurring Buy in the amount and interval you instruct. Recurring Buys will be placed as market orders on the applicable day and will be executed at the then-effective Conversion Rate (defined below). Recurring Buys may not occur at the same time on each day of the periodic interval. You may not receive prior notification of Recurring Buys before they occur. Block may set minimum transaction requirements for Recurring Buys. If you do not have sufficient funds available for any Recurring Buy, we may make additional attempts to pull funds, wait to retry on the next scheduled Recurring Buy, or cancel the Recurring Buy altogether. You may cancel Recurring Buys at any time. Recurring Buys will continue until cancelled by you or Block.

If you set up and enable Round Ups, you authorize and instruct Block, Inc. to debit Fiat Currency from your Cash App balance to purchase bitcoin on your behalf for the Round Up amount each time your Cash Card is used..  The amount of each Round Up will be determined by “rounding up” your Cash Card purchase to the next whole dollar amount when the Cash Card transaction settles and purchasing bitcoin in that amount at the then-effective Conversion Rate (defined below). Your Cash Card transaction may settle 1-3 days after you use your Cash Card. Cash Card transaction settlement times may vary, and the Cash Card transaction amount may change (for example, if you add a tip).  The price of Bitcoin may vary at the time a Round Up is made. Cash App Investing may set minimum transaction requirements for Round Ups. You may disable Round Ups at any time, but we may be unable to stop pending Round Ups. Cash App may cancel or modify any Round Up for any reason in its sole discretion. If you do not have sufficient funds available for any Round Up, we may make additional attempts to pull funds, wait to retry on your next Round Up, or cancel the Round Up altogether.

You are solely responsible for providing accurate instructions and directions for any Virtual Currency Withdrawal, and we are not liable to you or any third party for any delay or loss incurred from a Virtual Currency Withdrawal executed according to your instructions. You should verify the accuracy of the External Virtual Currency Address prior to initiating a Virtual Currency Withdrawal. Virtual Currency Withdrawals may not be reversed or refunded once they have been initiated. We do not have control over any Supported Network for any Virtual Currency Withdrawal and cannot guarantee that the Supported Network will confirm the transaction or execute it correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eb. \u003cstrong\u003eDeposits.\u003c/strong\u003e You may transfer Virtual Currency from an External Virtual Currency Address to your Hosted Balance, minus the fees detailed below and subject to the restrictions in these terms (a “Virtual Currency Deposit”). Only supported Virtual Currencies may be deposited with Cash App, and any Virtual Currency Deposit you initiate must conform to the protocols of the receiving Virtual Currency wallet. The person initiating a Virtual Currency Deposit is solely responsible for executing the transaction correctly, including payment of any applicable network fees. We are not responsible for any erroneous or delayed Virtual Currency Deposit for any reason, including erroneous instructions or address information. Virtual Currency Deposits must be recognized by the required number of network confirmations, or otherwise authorized pursuant to network confirmation requirements, for the relevant Supported Network, and may be delayed before appearing in your Hosted Balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ec. \u003cstrong\u003eTransfer Limitations.\u003c/strong\u003e We may, in our sole discretion, impose limitations or restrictions on the size, type, or manner of any transfer transactions, such as a limit on the total amount of Virtual Currency that may be transferred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ed. \u003cstrong\u003eTransfer Fees.\u003c/strong\u003e We may charge fees for Virtual Currency Deposits or Virtual Currency Withdrawals, including fees imposed by the relevant Supported Network if applicable, which will be shown to you at or prior to your confirmation of the transaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ee. \u003cstrong\u003eCompatibility.\u003c/strong\u003e Only supported Virtual Currencies may be transferred to or from your Hosted Balance.

A Virtual Currency Withdrawal or Virtual Currency Deposit is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Virtual Currency Withdrawals that are initiated from your Hosted Balance will be in a pending transaction state, and the relevant value of the pending Virtual Currency Withdrawal will not be available in your Hosted Balance. If your attempted Virtual Currency Withdrawal over a Supported Network fails, the relevant Virtual Currency amount will remain in your Hosted Balance. You bear the risk of loss of value once you have initiated a transfer transaction to or from your Hosted Balance in the event that the receipt of virtual currency is delayed and the value of virtual currency decreases during the period of delay. We are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of any errors in the initiation of a transfer transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eg. \u003cstrong\u003eThird Parties.\u003c/strong\u003e We are not responsible for any goods or services that you may receive from, or any action by, a third party with respect to any transfer of Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you have a dispute with any third party with respect to any Virtual Currency transfer you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e5.

In the event the “Sell” feature is available, Block will then purchase such amount of Virtual Currency from you and deposit the value of Virtual Currency in your Cash App as Fiat Currency. The price you receive for any Virtual Currency sold to Block may vary based on market factors, including the price and volume of the Virtual Currency you are attempting to sell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eb. \u003cstrong\u003eNo Guarantee.\u003c/strong\u003e Block does not guarantee the availability of “Sell” transactions, or your ability to sell Virtual Currency held in your Hosted Balance. The act of selling Virtual Currency to Block does not create a guarantee that you may sell Virtual Currency to Block at a later time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e6. Peer to Peer Bitcoin Transfers\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCash App may allow you to initiate peer-to-peer bitcoin transfers to other Cash App customers within the app (each transfer, a “P2P Bitcoin Transaction”). P2P Bitcoin Transactions are “off-chain” transactions facilitated by Block. As such they are not broadcast to the bitcoin network and will not be reflected on the public ledger. All bitcoin transferred via P2P Bitcoin Transactions are custodied by Block. P2P Bitcoin Transactions may only be completed between Virtual Currency Accounts; if you initiate a P2P Bitcoin Transaction to a Cash App Account that is not an Virtual Currency Account, the recipient must take the necessary steps to become an Virtual Currency Account before the transaction will be completed. If the recipient fails to open a Virtual Currency Account for any reason within the required period of time, the attempted P2P Bitcoin Transaction will be voided and the bitcoin returned to your account. Once you accept a P2P Bitcoin Transaction, any subsequent P2P Bitcoin Transaction to you will be automatically completed into your Hosted Balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with P2P Bitcoin Transactions at any time subject to these Virtual Currency Terms. Any fees assessed will be reflected in app at or prior to your confirmation of the transaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may impose transaction limits on P2P Bitcoin Transactions in our sole discretion. Fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of Virtual Currency with no recourse. It is your responsibility to provide accurate instructions for any P2P Bitcoin Transactions, and Block is not responsible for any P2P Bitcoin Transactions facilitated based on inaccurate or incomplete instructions.\nP2P Bitcoin Transactions occur in bitcoin denominations (i.e. “satoshis”). You may have the option to choose an estimated amount of a P2P Bitcoin Transaction denominated in dollars. Prior to sending any P2P Bitcoin Transaction you will be shown the amount of the transfer denominated in bitcoin; it is your responsibility to ensure that the transfer amount in bitcoin is correct. All estimated denominations of P2P Bitcoin Transactions in dollars are based on the then-effective Conversion Rate and are not a guarantee or promise of the amount of bitcoin that will be transferred. The value of bitcoin can fluctuate rapidly and Block does not guarantee the dollar value of any P2P Bitcoin Transaction. Bitcoin received via P2P Bitcoin Transaction may lose value, and recipients will not be reimbursed for such losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e7. Fees\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may charge fees for Virtual Currency transactions within Cash App, including any purchase, sale, transfer, or transaction on any Supported Network.

We may change the fees at any time, with or without notice to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e8. Conversion Rate\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may buy or sell Virtual Currency through the Virtual Currency Services. Any such buy or sell transaction is subject to the Block “Conversion Rate” for the given transaction. “Conversion Rate” means the price of Virtual Currency in terms of Fiat Currency as displayed in the Cash App once you have selected “Buy” or “Sell” and such Conversion Rate is the price in terms of Fiat Currency at which you may buy Virtual Currency from or sell Virtual Currency to Block. You acknowledge that Block may add a margin or “spread” between the quoted mid market price displayed on the Virtual Currency dashboard and the quoted buy or sell price and, as such, that the quoted buy price Conversion Rate may not be the same as the sell price Conversion Rate at any given time. You agree, as a condition of buying or selling Virtual Currency through the Cash App, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric. You have no obligation to accept the offered buy or sell price for Virtual Currency in the Cash App.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e9.

Bitcoin Boost Program\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlock may offer a bitcoin boost for eligible Cash Card holders (the “Bitcoin Boost”). If you have activated a Bitcoin Boost, for any eligible transaction on the Cash Card during the period of time when the Bitcoin Boost is active, you will receive the applicable boost percentage of the transaction amount (e.g. 1%) in Fiat Currency from Block, up to any applicable maximum total boost amount (the “Boost Funds”). The Boost Funds will then automatically be used for a Buy in an amount equal to the Boost Funds, and such purchased bitcoin will be deposited in your holdings. By activating any Bitcoin Boost, you authorize and instruct Block to place a Buy in the amount of the Boost Funds (each, a “Boost Buy”). No fees will apply to Boost Buys. Boost Buys will be placed as market orders on the applicable day and will be executed at the then-effective Conversion Rate. You may not receive prior notification of Boost Buys before they occur. There may be delays in the time between the eligible Cash Card transaction and the Boost Buy, during which time the Conversion Rate may have changed. Boost Buys are subject to available bitcoin inventory. Bitcoin may lose value. You may end up with bitcoin of lower value than the original Boost Funds, and any such loss of value will not be replaced. Block may set restrictions on when Bitcoin Boosts are available, the amount and percentage of Bitcoin Boosts, and other eligibility and program criteria. You may inactivate a Bitcoin Boost at any time in Cash App. Block may cancel or modify any Boost Buy for any reason in its sole discretion. Bitcoin Boosts are only available to eligible Cash Card holders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e14.

You will be presented with a confirmation page prior to submitting the VC Custom Order instructions that will specify details about the VC Custom Order including any applicable fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you initiate your VC Custom Order, we will pull funds in the amount of the VC Custom Order, including any applicable fees, either (i) from your Cash App Balance in the case of a “Buy,” or (ii) from your Hosted Balance in the case of a “Sell.” If you initiate a VC Custom Order “Buy” in an amount that exceeds your current Cash App Balance, you authorize us to Add Cash to your Cash App Balance from an External Account or as otherwise permissible under the Cash App Terms, in an amount sufficient to cover your VC Custom Order and any applicable fees. You may not initiate a VC Custom Order “Sell” in an amount that exceeds your current Hosted Balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly in the event that the Conversion Rate matches the Trigger Price (the “\u003cstrong\u003eTrigger Event\u003c/strong\u003e”) will the contingent Buy or Sell transaction associated with your VC Custom Order execute. By initiating a VC Custom Order, you authorize Block to place a Buy or Sell, as applicable, in the amount specified in the VC Custom Order upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event. The Trigger Event is based exclusively on the Conversion Rate, and we will determine when the Trigger Price is reached in our sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that the Conversion Rate is the sole metric used for purposes of determining whether the Trigger Event has occurred, and prices for Virtual Currency on other third party exchanges, markets, or otherwise are not considered or binding. Notwithstanding any prohibition on cancellations that may apply to the Virtual Currency Services in general, you may cancel your VC Custom Order at any time prior to the occurrence of the Trigger Event. We may cancel or modify any outstanding VC Custom Order at any time without notice to you, in our sole discretion. During the time that your VC Custom Order is pending and prior to its cancellation, expiration, or the occurrence of the Trigger Event, the funds or Virtual Currency used to place the VC Custom Order will not appear in your Cash App Balance or Hosted Balance, as applicable. If your VC Custom Order is canceled or expires, the funds or Virtual Currency, together with any fees, will be returned to your Cash App Balance or Hosted Balance, as applicable. We will not be liable to you for any loss incurred as a result of the cancellation of your VC Custom Order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVC Custom Orders are an advanced order type; you should understand the risks of Virtual Currency transactions generally, and of placing advanced orders specifically, before placing a VC Custom Order. If you choose to place a VC Custom Order, you agree you do so at your own risk. Any outage or interruption to Cash App’s service availability more broadly (including as a result of a service interruption caused by a third party) may impact the time that you are able to initiate or cancel your VC Custom Order. We will not be liable to you in the event that you are not able to place or cancel your VC Custom Order as a result of such outage or interruption to Cash App’s service availability. Please carefully review the Virtual Currency risk disclosures before placing any VC Custom Order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e15. Virtual Currency Gifting\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCash App may permit you to send or receive a Virtual Currency-denominated gift to or from other Cash App users, respectively, or to receive such a gift from us as part of a promotional marketing interaction (each, a “\u003cstrong\u003eVirtual Currency Gift\u003c/strong\u003e”). When initiating a Virtual Currency Gift transaction, the sender does not, in fact, transfer Virtual Currency to the recipient. Rather, the sender of a Virtual Currency Gift is sending Fiat Currency to the recipient via Cash App’s Peer-to-Peer Service, using the Cash App Balance held by the sender, and Cash App will prompt the recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift to complete a Buy order to purchase Virtual Currency with the Fiat Currency received from the sender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift has no obligation to purchase Virtual Currency with the Fiat Currency received. If the recipient chooses not to complete a Buy order upon receipt of the Virtual Current Gift, or if the recipient fails to complete a Buy order within 21 days of receiving a Virtual Currency Gift, then (i) in the case of a Virtual Currency Gift received from another Cash App user, the gifted funds will be deposited as Fiat Currency into the recipient’s Cash App Balance, and (ii) in the case of a Virtual Currency Gift received from us as part of a promotional marketing interaction, the gifted funds will be returned to us. The recipient is solely responsible for submitting a Buy order to acquire Virtual Currency using the Fiat Currency received via the Virtual Currency Gift, and such Buy order is entirely at the direction and instruction of the recipient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou acknowledge and agree that the value of Virtual Currency at the time a sender initiates a Virtual Currency Gift may be higher or lower, relative to Fiat Currency, than the value of Virtual Currency at the time a recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift chooses to accept such gift and place a Virtual Currency Buy order. Moreover, Virtual Currency purchased by the recipient, as a result of a Virtual Currency Gift, may lose value, and any lost value will not be reimbursed or replaced by us. Purchasing bitcoin is a risky activity and may involve loss. Please carefully review the Virtual Currency risk disclosures before placing any VC Custom Order.\nFollowing the receipt of a Virtual Currency Gift and the placement of a subsequent Buy order of Virtual Currency, a recipient will have to sell its Virtual Currency in order to receive any Fiat Currency. Selling Virtual Currency may have tax implications, and we will not provide any reimbursement or compensation for the tax consequences of selling Virtual Currency. If you have questions about your particular tax situation, you should consult a tax advisor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e16.

YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST BLOCK.

Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (“Notice”). Any Notice to Block should be sent by mail to Block, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may elect, in writing sent to the other party, that it will pursue the matter either through small claims court or arbitration. The party receiving the notice shall then have seven (7) days to respond, including to elect for the case to be heard by a small claims court with jurisdiction. If either party elects small claims court, the dispute will be resolved in that forum and not through arbitration. Each party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScope of Arbitration.\u003c/strong\u003e If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf\"\u003eConsumer Arbitration Rules\u003c/a\u003e through the Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (the “Desk/Documents Only” arbitration) (the “AAA Rules”), including Rule D-3(b), except you and Block will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and so long as the claim is arbitrable under the AAA Rules. Except as set forth above, and for disputes subject to jurisdiction in small claims court, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Cash App Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmall Claims Court.\u003c/strong\u003e Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.
