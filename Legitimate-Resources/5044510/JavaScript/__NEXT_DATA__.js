That is because Personal Health Information (or “PHI”) is a rich source of personal data that can be used in identity theft. The black market resale value of PHI is estimated to be ten times higher than credit card data. While credit cards can be cancelled or replaced, PHI – including name, age, gender, address, Social Security numbers, diagnosis codes, insurance information and personal medical history – can’t be changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCriminals may use this stolen medical information to create fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or combine a patient number with a provider number and file false claims with insurers. Having access to detailed personal data can also make targeted email or spear phishing attacks easier and more effective, and threats to disclose private and potentially embarrassing medical information could be used for potentially lucrative blackmail schemes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCase Status\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 23, 2016, Gibbs Law Group partner Eric Gibbs was appointed by United States District Judge Bolton of the District of Arizona to serve on the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee.
