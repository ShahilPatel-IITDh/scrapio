            2. Fees and Service.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Capital Confirmation provides a venue for digital transaction management, including but not limited to, audit confirmations, accounts receivable/accounts payable confirmations, credit inquiries, employee benefit plan audits and confirmations, and legal confirmations for accounting firms, law firms, banks, and other users, (the “Service”). The Service also includes the provision of ancillary services deemed reasonably necessary by Capital Confirmation to run a venue for digital transaction management, including but not limited to customer support, billing, and account management.
          </p>
          <p>
           Joining our service is free. There is a charge for requesting and receiving confirmations. Our
           <a href="https://www.confirmation.com/resources/uncategorized/fees-and-credit-policy/">
            Fees and Credit Policy is available here
           </a>
           and is incorporated by reference. We may change our Fees and Credit Policy and the fees for our services from time to time. Our changes to the policy are effective upon our posting of an updated Fee Policy on the
           <a href="https://www.confirmation.com/">
            www.confirmation.com
           </a>
           website. We may choose to temporarily change our Fee Policy and the fees for our services for promotional events and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event on the
           <a href="http://www.confirmation.com/">
            www.confirmation.com
           </a>
           website. When you purchase a confirmation you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged for the use of our services. We may in our sole discretion change some or all of our services at any time. In the event we introduce a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all fees associated with using our service and our website and all applicable taxes.
          </p>

           <strong>
            3. Capital Confirmation is a Venue.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.1 Capital Confirmation is not a bank or law firm nor are we an authorized bank or law firm representative.
           </strong>
           Instead, our site acts as a venue to allow users to request, receive, and buy confirmations at any time, from anywhere. We are not involved in the actual transaction between users of and providers of the confirmation information. As a result, we have no control over the quality, accuracy, timeliness or legality of the requests and the responses, or the truth or accuracy of the requests and responses. We also cannot ensure that a provider will actually complete a transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.2 Identity Verification.
           </strong>
           We use many techniques to identify our users when they register on our site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Capital Confirmation cannot and does not confirm each user’s purported identity. Thus, we have established a user-initiated communication system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing. We encourage you to communicate directly with individual parties through the tools available on our site.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.3 Release.

           Because we are a venue, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Capital Confirmation (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

           The Out-of-Network confirmation service requires the requestor to enter the contact information for the responder and the responder’s company. Because you as the requestor determine who and at which entity an out-of-network confirmation is directed, and therefore which entity and who at that entity is the responder, you agree to accept full and sole responsibility for the verification and validation of the identity of the individual responder and the company they claim to represent. You understand that Capital Confirmation has not and will not validate the identity of the responder or the company they claim to represent.

            You release and hold harmless Capital Confirmation from any and all claims related to the responder’s identity and/or the identity of the company the responder claims to represent if you request confirmations through

            2. Fees and Service.
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Capital Confirmation provides a venue for digital transaction management, including but not limited to, audit confirmations, accounts receivable/accounts payable confirmations, credit inquiries, employee benefit plan audits and confirmations, and legal confirmations for accounting firms, law firms, banks, and other users (the “Service”). Joining and using our service to respond to audit confirmations is free. Our changes to the policy are effective after we provide you with at least fourteen (14) days’ notice of the changes by posting the changes in this Agreement. In the event we introduce a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. The Service also includes the provision of ancillary services deemed reasonably necessary by Capital Confirmation to run a venue for digital transaction management, including but not limited to customer support, billing, and account management.

            3. Capital Confirmation is a Venue.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.1 Capital Confirmation is not an accounting firm or client user nor are we an authorized accounting firm or client user representative.
           </strong>
           Instead, our site acts as a venue to allow users to respond to audit confirmations. We are not involved in the actual transaction between users of and providers of the confirmation information. As a result, we have no control over the quality, accuracy, timeliness or legality of the requests and the responses, or the truth or accuracy of the requests and responses.

            3.2 Identity Verification.
           </strong>
           We use many techniques to identify our users when they register on our site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Capital Confirmation cannot and does not confirm each user’s purported identity. Thus, we have established a user-initiated communication system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing. We encourage you to communicate directly with individual parties through the tools available on our site.

           <strong>
            3.3 Release.
           </strong>
           Because we are a venue, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Capital Confirmation (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           By responding to a confirmation request you agree to be bound by the conditions of this Agreement. Responses are not retractable. If you choose to respond to a confirmation you are certifying that you have the legal right to respond to such confirmations on behalf of the company you purport to represent and work for, or in the case of an individual who is responding, you are certifying that you are the person you purport to be.

            2. Fees and Service.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Capital Confirmation provides a venue for digital transaction management, including but not limited to, audit confirmations, accounts receivable/accounts payable confirmations, credit inquiries, employee benefit plan audits and confirmations, and legal confirmations for accounting firms, law firms, banks, and other users (the “Service”). Joining and using our Service to respond to audit confirmations is free. We may in our sole discretion change some or all of our services at any time. In the event we introduce a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. The Service also includes the provision of ancillary services deemed reasonably necessary by Capital Confirmation to run a venue for digital transaction management, including but not limited to customer support, billing, and account management.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3. Capital Confirmation is a Venue.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.1 Capital Confirmation is not a bank or law firm nor are we an authorized bank or law firm representative.
           </strong>
           Instead, our site acts as a venue to allow users to request and receive confirmations at anytime, from anywhere. We are not involved in the actual transaction between users of and providers of the confirmation information. As a result, we have no control over the quality, accuracy, timeliness or legality of the requests and the responses, or the truth or accuracy of the requests and responses. We also cannot ensure that a provider will actually complete a transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.2 Identity Verification.
           </strong>
           We use many techniques to identify our users when they register on our site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Capital Confirmation cannot and does not confirm each user’s purported identity. Thus, we have established a user-initiated communication system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing.

            3.3 Release.
           </strong>
           Because we are a venue, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Capital Confirmation (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

            9. Confidentiality of Law Firm Information
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           a. The Law Firm’s transmittal of Law Firm Information to Auditors through the Confirmation.com Service shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege that applies to such Law Firm Information.
          </p>
          <p>
           b. The Provider represents and warrants to the Law Firm that the Confirmation.com Service is an electronic conduit to facilitate the delivery of requests for information and responses thereto in connection with audit services conducted for the Law Firm’s Clients by Auditors. In accordance with the Provider’s stated security and privacy policies, the Provider shall maintain physical and technological security safeguards to protect the confidentiality of all Law Firm Information transmitted via the Confirmation.com Service.
          </p>
          <p>
           c. The Provider agrees that all Law Firm Information is to be treated confidentially and that, except as required by law, the Provider shall not provide any Law Firm Information to any person, other than Auditors within the scope of the relevant Client’s authorization, without the prior written consent of the Law Firm.
          </p>
          <p>
           d. If the Provider is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Law Firm Information, the Provider shall provide the Law Firm with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Law Firm may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other appropriate remedy or the receipt of a waiver from the Law Firm, the Provider is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose the Law Firm Information to any tribunal or other entity or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Provider may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal or other entity only that portion of the Law Firm Information which the Provider is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Provider exercises its best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Law Firm Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Law Firm without expense to the Provider, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Law Firm Information by such tribunal or other entity.

            3. Capital Confirmation is a Venue.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.1 Capital Confirmation is not a bank or law firm nor are we an authorized bank or law firm representative.
           </strong>
           Instead, our site acts as a venue to allow users to request, receive, and buy confirmations at any time, from anywhere. We are not involved in the actual transaction between users of and providers of the confirmation information. As a result, we have no control over the quality, accuracy, timeliness or legality of the requests and the responses, or the truth or accuracy of the requests and responses. We also cannot ensure that a provider will actually complete a transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.2 Identity Verification.
           </strong>
           We use many techniques to identify our users when they register on our site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Capital Confirmation cannot and does not confirm each user’s purported identity. Thus, we have established a user-initiated communication system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing. We encourage you to communicate directly with individual parties through the tools available on our site.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.3 Release.
           </strong>
           Because we are a venue, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Capital Confirmation (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3.4 Information Control.
           </strong>
           We do not control the information provided by other users that is made available through our system. You may find other user’s information to be inaccurate. Please use caution, common sense, and safe practices when using our site.

           The Out-of-Network confirmation service requires the requestor to enter the contact information for the responder and the responder’s company.

You understand that Capital Confirmation has not and will not validate the identity of the responder or the company they claim to represent.

            Responses received electronically, for example by facsimile or electronic mail, involve risks as to reliability because proof of origin and authority of the respondent may be difficult to establish, and alterations may be difficult to detect. A process used by the auditor and the respondent that creates a secure environment for responses received electronically may mitigate these risks. If the auditor is satisfied that such a process is secure and properly controlled, the reliability of the related responses is enhanced. An electronic confirmation process might incorporate various techniques for validating the identity of a sender of information in electronic form, for example, through the use of encryption, electronic digital signatures, and procedures to verify web site authenticity.
